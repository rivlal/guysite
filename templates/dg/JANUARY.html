When the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to him<br>

Some Pharisees were also sent. <br> 
They asked him,<br> 
“Why then do you baptize<br> 
if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?” <br> 
John answered them,<br> 
“I baptize with water;<br>

This is the message you have heard from the beginning:<br>
we should love one another,<br>
unlike Cain who belonged to the Evil One<br>
and slaughtered his brother.<br>
Why did he slaughter him?<br>
Because his own works were evil,<br>
and those of his brother righteous.<br>
Do not be amazed, then, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.<br>
We know that we have passed from death to life<br>
because we love our brothers.<br>
Whoever does not love remains in death.<br>
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,<br>
and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.<br>
The way we came to know love<br>
was that he laid down his life for us;<br>
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.<br>
If someone who has worldly means<br>
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,<br>
how can the love of God remain in him?<br>
Children, let us love not in word or speech<br>
but in deed and truth.<br><br>

Now this is how we shall know that we belong to the truth<br>
and reassure our hearts before him<br>
in whatever our hearts condemn,<br>
for God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.<br>
Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us,<br>

Who indeed is the victor over the world<br>
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<br><br>

This is the one who came through water and Blood, Jesus Christ,<br>
not by water alone, but by water and Blood.<br>
The Spirit is the one who testifies,<br>
and the Spirit is truth.<br>
So there are three that testify,<br>
the Spirit, the water, and the Blood,<br>
and the three are of one accord.<br>
If we accept human testimony,<br>
the testimony of God is surely greater.<br>
Now the testimony of God is this,<br>
that he has testified on behalf of his Son.<br>
Whoever believes in the Son of God<br>
has this testimony within himself.<br>
Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar<br>
by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.<br>
And this is the testimony:<br>
God gave us eternal life,<br>
and this life is in his Son.<br>
Whoever possesses the Son has life;<br>
whoever does not possess the Son of God does not have life.<br><br>

I write these things to you so that you may know<br>
that you have eternal life,<br>
you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</td>

behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, <br>
“Where is the newborn king of the Jews?<br>
We saw his star at its rising<br>

When King Herod heard this,<br>
he was greatly troubled, <br>

Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, <br>
He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.<br>
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, <br>
for thus it has been written through the prophet:<br>
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,<br>
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>
since from you shall come a ruler,<br>
who is to shepherd my people Israel.”<br>
Then Herod called the magi secretly <br>
and ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearance.<br>
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, <br>
“Go and search diligently for the child.<br>
When you have found him, bring me word, <br>
that I too may go and do him homage.”<br>
After their audience with the king they set out.<br>
And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them,<br> 
until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.<br>
They were overjoyed at seeing the star, <br>
and on entering the house<br>
they saw the child with Mary his mother.<br>
They prostrated themselves and did him homage.<br>
Then they opened their treasures <br>
and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br>
And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, <br>
they departed for their country by another way.</td>

near the doorpost of the LORD’s temple.<br>
In her bitterness she prayed to the LORD, weeping copiously,<br>
and she made a vow, promising: “O LORD of hosts,<br>
if you look with pity on the misery of your handmaid,<br>
if you remember me and do not forget me,<br>
if you give your handmaid a male child,<br>
I will give him to the LORD for as long as he lives;<br>

though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard.<br>
Eli, thinking her drunk, said to her,<br>
“How long will you make a drunken show of yourself?<br>
Sober up from your wine!”<br>
“It isn’t that, my lord,” Hannah answered.<br>
“I am an unhappy woman.<br>
I have had neither wine nor liquor;<br>
I was only pouring out my troubles to the LORD.<br>
Do not think your handmaid a ne’er-do-well;<br>
my prayer has been prompted by my deep sorrow and misery.”<br>

She replied, “Think kindly of your maidservant,” and left.<br>
She went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband,<br>

a revelation of the LORD was uncommon and vision infrequent.<br>
One day Eli was asleep in his usual place.<br>
His eyes had lately grown so weak that he could not see.<br>
The lamp of God was not yet extinguished,<br>
and Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD<br>
where the ark of God was.<br>
The LORD called to Samuel, who answered, “Here I am.”<br><br>

Samuel ran to Eli and said, “Here I am.  You called me.”<br>
“I did not call you,” Eli said.  “Go back to sleep.” <br>
So he went back to sleep.<br>
Again the LORD called Samuel, who rose and went to Eli.<br>
“Here I am,” he said. “You called me.”<br>
But Eli answered, “I did not call you, my son. Go back to sleep.”<br>
At that time Samuel was not familiar with the LORD,<br>
because the LORD had not revealed anything to him as yet.<br>
The LORD called Samuel again, for the third time.<br>
Getting up and going to Eli, he said, “Here I am. <br>
You called me.”<br>
Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the youth.<br>
So Eli said to Samuel, “Go to sleep, and if you are called, reply,<br>
‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.’” <br>
When Samuel went to sleep in his place,<br>
the LORD came and revealed his presence,<br>
calling out as before, “Samuel, Samuel!”<br>
Samuel answered, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”<br><br>

Samuel grew up, and the LORD was with him,<br>
not permitting any word of his to be without effect.<br>
Thus all Israel from Dan to Beersheba<br>
came to know that Samuel was an accredited prophet of the LORD.</td>

The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were with the ark of God.<br>
When the ark of the LORD arrived in the camp,<br>
all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth resounded.<br>
The Philistines, hearing the noise of shouting, asked,<br>
“What can this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?”<br>
On learning that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp,<br>
the Philistines were frightened.<br>
They said, “Gods have come to their camp.”<br>
They said also, “Woe to us! This has never happened before. Woe to us!<br>
Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods?<br>
These are the gods that struck the Egyptians<br>
with various plagues and with pestilence.<br>
Take courage and be manly, Philistines;<br>
otherwise you will become slaves to the Hebrews,<br>
as they were your slaves.<br>
So fight manfully!” <br>
The Philistines fought and Israel was defeated;<br>
every man fled to his own tent.<br>
It was a disastrous defeat,<br>
.in which Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.<br>
The ark of God was captured,<br>
and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were among the dead.

            <td class="aceem">All the elders of Israel came in a body to Samuel at Ramah<br>
and said to him, “Now that you are old,<br>
and your sons do not follow your example,<br>
appoint a king over us, as other nations have, to judge us.”<br><br>

Samuel was displeased when they asked for a king to judge them.<br>
He prayed to the LORD, however, who said in answer:<br>
“Grant the people’s every request.<br>
It is not you they reject, they are rejecting me as their king.”<br><br>

Samuel delivered the message of the LORD in full<br>
to those who were asking him for a king.<br>
He told them:<br>
“The rights of the king who will rule you will be as follows:<br>
He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots and horses,<br>
and they will run before his chariot.<br>
He will also appoint from among them his commanders of groups<br>
of a thousand and of a hundred soldiers.<br>
He will set them to do his plowing and his harvesting,<br>
and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.<br> 
He will use your daughters as ointment makers, as cooks, and as bakers.<br>
He will take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive groves,<br>
and give them to his officials.<br>
He will tithe your crops and your vineyards,<br>
and give the revenue to his eunuchs and his slaves.<br>
He will take your male and female servants,<br>
as well as your best oxen and your asses,<br>
and use them to do his work.<br>
He will tithe your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves.<br>
When this takes place,<br>
you will complain against the king whom you have chosen,<br>
but on that day the LORD will not answer you.”<br><br>

The people, however, refused to listen to Samuel’s warning and said,<br>
“Not so!  There must be a king over us.<br>
We too must be like other nations,<br>
with a king to rule us and to lead us in warfare<br>
and fight our battles.” <br>
When Samuel had listened to all the people had to say,<br>
he repeated it to the LORD, who then said to him,<br>
“Grant their request and appoint a king to rule them.”</td>

He had a son named Saul, who was a handsome young man.<br>
There was no other child of Israel more handsome than Saul;<br>
he stood head and shoulders above the people.<br><br>

Now the asses of Saul’s father, Kish, had wandered off.<br>
Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you<br>
and go out and hunt for the asses.”<br>
Accordingly they went through the hill country of Ephraim,<br>
and through the land of Shalishah.<br>
Not finding them there,<br>
they continued through the land of Shaalim without success.<br>
They also went through the land of Benjamin,<br>
but they failed to find the animals.<br><br>

When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD assured him,<br>
“This is the man of whom I told you; he is to govern my people.”<br><br>

Saul met Samuel in the gateway and said,<br>
“Please tell me where the seer lives.”<br>
Samuel answered Saul: “I am the seer.<br>
Go up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today.<br>
In the morning, before dismissing you,<br>
I will tell you whatever you wish.”<br><br>

Then, from a flask he had with him, Samuel poured oil on Saul’s head;<br>

Fill your horn with oil, and be on your way.<br>

Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I myself will tell you what to do;<br>

Samuel did as the LORD had commanded him.<br>
When he entered Bethlehem,<br>
the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and inquired,<br>
“Is your visit peaceful, O seer?”<br>
He replied:<br>
“Yes!  I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.<br>
So cleanse yourselves and join me today for the banquet.”<br>
He also had Jesse and his sons cleanse themselves<br>
and invited them to the sacrifice.<br>
As they came, he looked at Eliab and thought,<br>
“Surely the LORD’s anointed is here before him.”<br>
But the LORD said to Samuel: <br>
“Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature,<br>
because I have rejected him.<br>
Not as man sees does God see,<br>
because he sees the appearance<br>
but the LORD looks into the heart.”<br>
Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him before Samuel,<br>
who said, “The LORD has not chosen him.”<br>
Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said,<br>
“The LORD has not chosen this one either.”<br>
In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel,<br>

“The LORD has not chosen any one of these.”<br>
Then Samuel asked Jesse,<br>
“Are these all the sons you have?”<br>
Jesse replied,<br>

"Let your majesty not lose courage.<br>
I am at your service to go and fight this Philistine."<br>
But Saul answered David,<br>
"You cannot go up against this Philistine and fight with him,<br>
for you are only a youth, while he has been a warrior from his youth."<br><br>

David continued:<br>
"The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear,<br>
will also keep me safe from the clutches of this Philistine."<br>
Saul answered David, "Go! the LORD will be with you."<br><br>

Then, staff in hand, David selected five smooth stones from the wadi<br>
and put them in the pocket of his shepherd's bag.<br>
With his sling also ready to hand, he approached the Philistine.<br><br>

With his shield bearer marching before him,<br>
the Philistine also advanced closer and closer to David.<br>
When he had sized David up,<br>
and seen that he was youthful, and ruddy, and handsome in appearance,<br>
the Philistine held David in contempt.<br>
The Philistine said to David,<br>
"Am I a dog that you come against me with a staff?"<br>
Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods<br>
and said to him, "Come here to me,<br>
and I will leave your flesh for the birds of the air<br>
and the beasts of the field."<br>
David answered him:<br>
"You come against me with sword and spear and scimitar,<br>
but I come against you in the name of the LORD of hosts,<br>
the God of the armies of Israel that you have insulted.<br>
Today the LORD shall deliver you into my hand;<br>
I will strike you down and cut off your head.<br>
This very day I will leave your corpse<br>
and the corpses of the Philistine army for the birds of the air<br>
and the beasts of the field;<br>
thus the whole land shall learn that Israel has a God.<br>
All this multitude, too,<br>
shall learn that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves.<br>
For the battle is the LORD's and he shall deliver you into our hands."<br><br>

The Philistine then moved to meet David at close quarters,<br>
while David ran quickly toward the battle line<br>
in the direction of the Philistine.<br>
David put his hand into the bag and took out a stone,<br>
hurled it with the sling,<br>
and struck the Philistine on the forehead.<br>
The stone embedded itself in his brow,<br>
and he fell prostrate on the ground.<br>
Thus David overcame the Philistine with sling and stone;<br>
he struck the Philistine mortally, and did it without a sword.<br>
Then David ran and stood over him;<br>
with the Philistine's own sword which he drew from its sheath<br>
he dispatched him and cut off his head.</td>

            <td class="aceem">When David and Saul approached<br>
(on David’s return after slaying the Philistine),<br>
women came out from each of the cities of Israel to meet King Saul,<br>
singing and dancing, with tambourines, joyful songs, and sistrums.<br>
The women played and sang:<br><br>

“Saul has slain his thousands,<br>
and David his ten thousands.”<br><br>

Saul was very angry and resentful of the song, for he thought:<br>
“They give David ten thousands, but only thousands to me.<br>
All that remains for him is the kingship.”<br>
And from that day on, Saul was jealous of David.<br><br>

Saul discussed his intention of killing David<br>
with his son Jonathan and with all his servants.<br>
But Saul’s son Jonathan, who was very fond of David, told him:<br>
“My father Saul is trying to kill you.<br>
Therefore, please be on your guard tomorrow morning;<br>
get out of sight and remain in hiding.<br>
I, however, will go out and stand beside my father<br>
in the countryside where you are, and will speak to him about you.<br>
If I learn anything, I will let you know.”<br><br>

Jonathan then spoke well of David to his father Saul, saying to him:<br>
“Let not your majesty sin against his servant David,<br>
for he has committed no offense against you,<br>
but has helped you very much by his deeds.<br>
When he took his life in his hands and slew the Philistine,<br>
and the LORD brought about a great victory<br>
for all Israel through him,<br>
you were glad to see it.<br>
Why, then, should you become guilty of shedding innocent blood<br>
by killing David without cause?”<br>
Saul heeded Jonathan’s plea and swore,
“As the LORD lives, he shall not be killed.”<br>
So Jonathan summoned David and repeated the whole conversation to him.<br>
Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and David served him as before.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Saul took three thousand picked men from all Israel<br>
and went in search of David and his men<br>
in the direction of the wild goat crags.<br>
When he came to the sheepfolds along the way, he found a cave,<br>
which he entered to relieve himself.<br>
David and his men were occupying the inmost recesses of the cave.<br><br>

David's servants said to him,<br>
"This is the day of which the LORD said to you,<br>
'I will deliver your enemy into your grasp;<br>
do with him as you see fit.'"<br>
So David moved up and stealthily cut off an end of Saul's mantle.<br>
Afterward, however, David regretted that he had cut off<br>
an end of Saul's mantle.<br>
He said to his men,<br>
"The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master,<br>
the LORD's anointed, as to lay a hand on him,<br>
for he is the LORD's anointed."<br>
With these words David restrained his men<br>
and would not permit them to attack Saul.<br>
Saul then left the cave and went on his way.<br>
David also stepped out of the cave, calling to Saul,<br>
"My lord the king!"<br>
When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground in homage and asked Saul:<br>
"Why do you listen to those who say,<br>
'David is trying to harm you'?<br>
You see for yourself today that the LORD just now delivered you<br>
into my grasp in the cave.<br>
I had some thought of killing you, but I took pity on you instead.<br>
I decided, 'I will not raise a hand against my lord,<br>
for he is the LORD's anointed and a father to me.'<br>
Look here at this end of your mantle which I hold.<br>
Since I cut off an end of your mantle and did not kill you,<br>
see and be convinced that I plan no harm and no rebellion.<br>
I have done you no wrong,<br>
though you are hunting me down to take my life.<br>
The LORD will judge between me and you,<br>
and the LORD will exact justice from you in my case.<br>
I shall not touch you.<br>
The old proverb says, 'From the wicked comes forth wickedness.'<br>
So I will take no action against you.<br>
Against whom are you on campaign, O king of Israel?<br>
Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, or a single flea!<br>
The LORD will be the judge; he will decide between me and you.<br>
May he see this, and take my part,<br>
and grant me justice beyond your reach!"<br>
When David finished saying these things to Saul, Saul answered,<br>
"Is that your voice, my son David?"<br>
And Saul wept aloud.<br>
Saul then said to David: "You are in the right rather than I;<br>
you have treated me generously, while I have done you harm.<br>
Great is the generosity you showed me today,<br>
when the LORD delivered me into your grasp<br>
and you did not kill me.<br>
For if a man meets his enemy, does he send him away unharmed?<br>
May the LORD reward you generously for what you have done this day.<br>
And now, I know that you shall surely be king<br>
and that sovereignty over Israel shall come into your possession."</td>

Then they abandoned their nets and followed him.<br>

David was thirty years old when he became king,<br>

seven years and six months in Hebron over Judah,<br>
and thirty-three years in Jerusalem<br>
over all Israel and Judah.<br><br>

Then the king and his men set out for Jerusalem<br>
against the Jebusites who inhabited the region.<br>
David was told, "You cannot enter here:<br>
the blind and the lame will drive you away!"<br>
which was their way of saying, "David cannot enter here."<br>
But David did take the stronghold of Zion, which is the City of David.

David grew steadily more powerful,
for the LORD of hosts was with him.</td>

Should you build me a house to dwell in?<br>
I have not dwelt in a house<br>
from the day on which I led the children of Israel<br>
out of Egypt to the present,<br>
but I have been going about in a tent under cloth.<br>
In all my wanderings everywhere among the children of Israel,<br>
did I ever utter a word to any one of the judges<br>
whom I charged to tend my people Israel, to ask:<br>
Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'<br><br>

"Now then, speak thus to my servant David,<br>
'The LORD of hosts has this to say:<br>
It was I who took you from the pasture<br>
and from the care of the flock<br>
to be commander of my people Israel.<br>
I have been with you wherever you went,<br>
and I have destroyed all your enemies before you.<br>
And I will make you famous like the great ones of the earth.<br>
I will fix a place for my people Israel;<br>
I will plant them so that they may dwell in their place<br>
without further disturbance.<br>
Neither shall the wicked continue to afflict them as they did of old,<br>
since the time I first appointed judges over my people Israel.<br>
I will give you rest from all your enemies.<br>
The LORD also reveals to you that he will establish a house for you.<br>
And when your time comes and you rest with your ancestors,<br>
I will raise up your heir after you, sprung from your loins,<br>
and I will make his Kingdom firm.<br>
It is he who shall build a house for my name.<br>
And I will make his royal throne firm forever.<br>
I will be a father to him,<br>

And if he does wrong,<br>

Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me;<br>

A very large crowd gathered around him<br>
so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.<br>
And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land.<br>
And he taught them at length in parables,<br>
and in the course of his instruction he said to them,<br>
"Hear this! A sower went out to sow.<br>
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,<br>
and the birds came and ate it up.<br>
Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil.<br>
It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.<br>
And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots.<br>
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it<br>
and it produced no grain.<br>
And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit.<br>
It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."<br>
He added, "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear."<br><br>

And when he was alone,<br>
those present along with the Twelve<br>
questioned him about the parables.<br>
He answered them,<br>
"The mystery of the Kingdom of God has been granted to you.<br>
But to those outside everything comes in parables, so that<br>
<i>they may look and see but not perceive,<br>
and hear and listen but not understand,<br>
    in order that they may not be converted and be forgiven."</i><br><br>

Jesus said to them, "Do you not understand this parable?<br>
Then how will you understand any of the parables?<br>
The sower sows the word.<br>
These are the ones on the path where the word is sown.<br>
As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once<br>
and takes away the word sown in them.<br>
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who,<br>
when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy.<br>
But they have no roots; they last only for a time.<br>
Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word,<br>
they quickly fall away.<br>
Those sown among thorns are another sort.<br>
They are the people who hear the word,<br>
but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches,<br>
and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word,<br>
and it bears no fruit.<br>
But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it<br>
and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold."</td>

about noon a great light from the sky suddenly shone around me.<br>
I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,<br>
'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'<br>
I replied, 'Who are you, sir?'<br>

'I am Jesus the Nazorean whom you are persecuting.'<br>
My companions saw the light<br>

I asked, 'What shall I do, sir?'<br>
The Lord answered me, 'Get up and go into Damascus,<br>
and there you will be told about everything<br>
appointed for you to do.'<br>
Since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light,<br>
I was led by hand by my companions and entered Damascus.<br>

"A certain Ananias, a devout observer of the law,<br>
and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,<br>
came to me and stood there and said,<br>
'Saul, my brother, regain your sight.'<br>
And at that very moment I regained my sight and saw him.<br>
Then he said,<br>
'The God of our ancestors designated you to know his will,<br>
to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of his voice;<br>
for you will be his witness before all<br>
to what you have seen and heard.<br>
Now, why delay?<br>
Get up and have yourself baptized and your sins washed away,<br>

Nathan said: "Judge this case for me!<br>
In a certain town there were two men, one rich, the other poor.<br>
The rich man had flocks and herds in great numbers.<br>
But the poor man had nothing at all<br>
except one little ewe lamb that he had bought.<br>
He nourished her, and she grew up with him and his children.<br>
She shared the little food he had<br>
and drank from his cup and slept in his bosom.<br>
She was like a daughter to him.<br>
Now, the rich man received a visitor,<br>
but he would not take from his own flocks and herds<br>
to prepare a meal for the wayfarer who had come to him.<br>
Instead he took the poor man's ewe lamb<br>
and made a meal of it for his visitor."<br>
David grew very angry with that man and said to him:<br>
"As the LORD lives, the man who has done this merits death!<br>
He shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold<br>
because he has done this and has had no pity."<br><br>

Then Nathan said to David: "You are the man!<br>
Thus says the LORD God of Israel:<br>
'The sword shall never depart from your house,<br>
because you have despised me<br>
and have taken the wife of Uriah to be your wife.'<br>
Thus says the LORD:<br>
'I will bring evil upon you out of your own house.<br>
I will take your wives while you live to see it,<br>
and will give them to your neighbor.<br>
He shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.<br>
You have done this deed in secret,<br>
but I will bring it about in the presence of all Israel,<br>
and with the sun looking down.'"<br><br>

Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD."<br>
Nathan answered David: "The LORD on his part has forgiven your sin:<br>
you shall not die.<br>
But since you have utterly spurned the LORD by this deed,<br>
the child born to you must surely die."<br>
Then Nathan returned to his house.<br><br>

The LORD struck the child that the wife of Uriah had borne to David,<br>
and it became desperately ill.<br>
David besought God for the child.<br>
He kept a fast, retiring for the night<br>
to lie on the ground clothed in sackcloth.<br>
The elders of his house stood beside him<br>
urging him to rise from the ground; but he would not,<br>
nor would he take food with them.</td>

"Up! Let us take flight, or none of us will escape from Absalom.<br>
Leave quickly, lest he hurry and overtake us,<br>
then visit disaster upon us and put the city to the sword."<br><br>

As David went up the Mount of Olives, he wept without ceasing.<br>
His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot.<br>
All those who were with him also had their heads covered<br>
and were weeping as they went.<br><br>

As David was approaching Bahurim,<br>
a man named Shimei, the son of Gera<br>
of the same clan as Saul's family,<br>
was coming out of the place, cursing as he came.<br>
He threw stones at David and at all the king's officers,<br>

were on David's right and on his left.<br>

"Away, away, you murderous and wicked man!<br>
The LORD has requited you for all the bloodshed in the family of Saul,<br>
in whose stead you became king,<br>
and the LORD has given over the kingdom to your son Absalom.<br>
And now you suffer ruin because you are a murderer."<br>
Abishai, son of Zeruiah, said to the king:<br>
"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?<br>
Let me go over, please, and lop off his head."<br>
But the king replied: "What business is it of mine or of yours,<br>
sons of Zeruiah, that he curses?<br>
Suppose the LORD has told him to curse David;<br>
who then will dare to say, 'Why are you doing this?'"<br>
Then the king said to Abishai and to all his servants:<br>
"If my own son, who came forth from my loins, is seeking my life,<br>
how much more might this Benjaminite do so?<br>
Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.<br>
Perhaps the LORD will look upon my affliction<br>
and make it up to me with benefits<br>
for the curses he is uttering this day."<br>

to the territory of the Gerasenes.<br>
When he got out of the boat,<br>
at once a man from the tombs who had an unclean spirit met him.<br>
The man had been dwelling among the tombs,<br>
and no one could restrain him any longer, even with a chain.<br>
In fact, he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains,<br>
but the chains had been pulled apart by him and the shackles smashed,<br>
and no one was strong enough to subdue him.<br>
Night and day among the tombs and on the hillsides<br>
he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones.<br>
Catching sight of Jesus from a distance,<br>
he ran up and prostrated himself before him,<br>
crying out in a loud voice,<br>
"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?<br>
I adjure you by God, do not torment me!"<br>
(He had been saying to him, "Unclean spirit, come out of the man!")<br>
He asked him, "What is your name?"<br>
He replied, "Legion is my name. There are many of us."<br>
And he pleaded earnestly with him<br>
not to drive them away from that territory.<br><br>

Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.<br>
And they pleaded with him,<br>
"Send us into the swine. Let us enter them."<br>
And he let them, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine.<br>
The herd of about two thousand rushed down a steep bank into the sea,<br>
where they were drowned.<br>
The swineherds ran away and reported the incident in the town<br>
and throughout the countryside.<br>
And people came out to see what had happened.<br>
As they approached Jesus,<br>
they caught sight of the man who had been possessed by Legion,<br>
sitting there clothed and in his right mind.<br>
And they were seized with fear.<br>
Those who witnessed the incident explained to them what had happened<br>
to the possessed man and to the swine.<br>
Then they began to beg him to leave their district.<br>
As he was getting into the boat,<br>
the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him.<br>
But Jesus would not permit him but told him instead,<br>
"Go home to your family and announce to them<br>
all that the Lord in his pity has done for you."<br>
Then the man went off and began to proclaim in the Decapolis<br>
what Jesus had done for him; and all were amazed.</td>

and, as the mule passed under the branches of a large terebinth,<br>
his hair caught fast in the tree.<br>
He hung between heaven and earth<br>
while the mule he had been riding ran off.<br>
Someone saw this and reported to Joab<br>
that he had seen Absalom hanging from a terebinth.<br>
And taking three pikes in hand,<br>
he thrust for the heart of Absalom,<br>
still hanging from the tree alive.<br><br>

Now David was sitting between the two gates,<br>
and a lookout went up to the roof of the gate above the city wall,<br>
where he looked about and saw a man running all alone.<br>
The lookout shouted to inform the king, who said,<br>
"If he is alone, he has good news to report."<br>
The king said, "Step aside and remain in attendance here."<br>
So he stepped aside and remained there.<br>
When the Cushite messenger came in, he said,<br>
"Let my lord the king receive the good news<br>
that this day the LORD has taken your part,<br>
freeing you from the grasp of all who rebelled against you."<br>
But the king asked the Cushite, "Is young Absalom safe?"<br>
The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king<br>
and all who rebel against you with evil intent<br>
be as that young man!"<br><br>

The king was shaken,<br>
and went up to the room over the city gate to weep.<br>
He said as he wept,<br>
"My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom!<br>
If only I had died instead of you,<br>
Absalom, my son, my son!"<br><br>

Joab was told that the king was weeping and mourning for Absalom;<br>
and that day's victory was turned into mourning for the whole army<br>
when they heard that the king was grieving for his son.</td>

to the other side,<br>
a large crowd gathered around him, and he stayed close to the sea.<br>
One of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came forward.<br>
Seeing him he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, saying,<br>
"My daughter is at the point of death.<br>
Please, come lay your hands on her<br>
that she may get well and live."<br>
He went off with him<br>
and a large crowd followed him.<br><br>

There was a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years.<br>
She had suffered greatly at the hands of many doctors<br>
and had spent all that she had.<br>
Yet she was not helped but only grew worse.<br>
She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd<br>
and touched his cloak.<br>
She said, "If I but touch his clothes, I shall be cured."<br>
Immediately her flow of blood dried up.<br>
She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.<br>
Jesus, aware at once that power had gone out from him,<br>
turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who has touched my clothes?"<br>
But his disciples said to him,<br>
"You see how the crowd is pressing upon you,<br>
and yet you ask, Who touched me?"<br>
And he looked around to see who had done it.<br>
The woman, realizing what had happened to her,<br>
approached in fear and trembling.<br>
She fell down before Jesus and told him the whole truth.<br>
He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has saved you.<br>
Go in peace and be cured of your affliction."<br><br>

While he was still speaking,<br>
people from the synagogue official's house arrived and said,<br>
"Your daughter has died; why trouble the teacher any longer?"<br>
Disregarding the message that was reported,<br>
Jesus said to the synagogue official,<br>
"Do not be afraid; just have faith."<br>
He did not allow anyone to accompany him inside<br>
except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.<br>
When they arrived at the house of the synagogue official,<br>
he caught sight of a commotion,<br>
people weeping and wailing loudly.<br>
So he went in and said to them,<br>
"Why this commotion and weeping?<br>
The child is not dead but asleep."<br>
And they ridiculed him.<br>
Then he put them all out.<br>
He took along the child's father and mother<br>
and those who were with him<br>
and entered the room where the child was.<br>
He took the child by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum,"<br>
which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise!"<br>
The girl, a child of twelve, arose immediately and walked around.<br>
At that they were utterly astounded.<br>
He gave strict orders that no one should know this<br>
and said that she should be given something to eat.</td>

and register the people, that I may know their number."<br>
Joab then reported to the king the number of people registered:<br>
in Israel, eight hundred thousand men fit for military service;<br>
in Judah, five hundred thousand.<br><br>

Afterward, however, David regretted having numbered the people,<br>
and said to the LORD:<br>
"I have sinned grievously in what I have done.<br>
But now, LORD, forgive the guilt of your servant,<br>
for I have been very foolish."<br>
When David rose in the morning,<br>
the LORD had spoken to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying:<br>
"Go and say to David, 'This is what the LORD says:<br>
I offer you three alternatives;<br>
choose one of them, and I will inflict it on you.'"<br>
Gad then went to David to inform him.<br>
He asked: "Do you want a three years' famine to come upon your land,<br>
or to flee from your enemy three months while he pursues you,<br>
or to have a three days' pestilence in your land?<br>
Now consider and decide what I must reply to him who sent me."<br>
David answered Gad: "I am in very serious difficulty.<br>
Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful;<br>
but let me not fall by the hand of man."<br>
Thus David chose the pestilence.<br>
Now it was the time of the wheat harvest<br>
when the plague broke out among the people.<br>
The LORD then sent a pestilence over Israel<br>
from morning until the time appointed,<br>
and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beer-sheba died.<br>
But when the angel stretched forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it,<br>
the LORD regretted the calamity<br>
and said to the angel causing the destruction among the people,<br>
"Enough now! Stay your hand."<br>
The angel of the LORD was then standing<br>
at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<br>
When David saw the angel who was striking the people,<br>
he said to the LORD: "It is I who have sinned;<br>
it is I, the shepherd, who have done wrong.<br>
But these are sheep; what have they done?<br>
Punish me and my kindred."</td>
