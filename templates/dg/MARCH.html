            <td class="aceem">Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons,<br>
for he was the child of his old age;<br>
and he had made him a long tunic.<br>
When his brothers saw that their father loved him best of all his sons,<br>
they hated him so much that they would not even greet him.<br><br>

One day, when his brothers had gone<br>
to pasture their father's flocks at Shechem,<br>
Israel said to Joseph,<br>
"Your brothers, you know, are tending our flocks at Shechem.<br>
Get ready; I will send you to them."<br><br>

So Joseph went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan.<br>
They noticed him from a distance,<br>
and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him.<br>
They said to one another: "Here comes that master dreamer!<br>
Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns here;<br>
we could say that a wild beast devoured him.<br>
We shall then see what comes of his dreams."<br><br>

When Reuben heard this,<br>
he tried to save him from their hands, saying,<br>
"We must not take his life.<br>
Instead of shedding blood," he continued,<br>
"just throw him into that cistern there in the desert;<br>
but do not kill him outright."<br>
His purpose was to rescue him from their hands<br>
and return him to his father.<br>
So when Joseph came up to them,<br>
they stripped him of the long tunic he had on;<br>
then they took him and threw him into the cistern,<br>
which was empty and dry.<br><br>

They then sat down to their meal.<br>
Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead,<br>
their camels laden with gum, balm and resin<br>
to be taken down to Egypt.<br>
Judah said to his brothers:<br>
"What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood?<br>
Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites,<br>
instead of doing away with him ourselves.<br>
After all, he is our brother, our own flesh."<br>
His brothers agreed.<br>
They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people:<br>
"Hear another parable.<br>
There was a landowner who planted a vineyard,<br>
put a hedge around it,<br>
dug a wine press in it, and built a tower.<br>
Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.<br>
When vintage time drew near,<br>
he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.<br>
But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat,<br>
another they killed, and a third they stoned.<br>
Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones,<br>
but they treated them in the same way.<br>
Finally, he sent his son to them,<br>
thinking, 'They will respect my son.'<br>
But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another,<br>
'This is the heir.<br>
Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'<br>
They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.<br>
What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?"<br>
They answered him,<br>
"He will put those wretched men to a wretched death<br>
and lease his vineyard to other tenants<br>
who will give him the produce at the proper times."<br>
Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures:<br><br>

<i>The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has become the cornerstone;<br>
by the Lord has this been done,<br>
    and it is wonderful in our eyes?</i><br><br>

Therefore, I say to you,<br>
the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you<br>
and given to a people that will produce its fruit."<br>
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,<br>
they knew that he was speaking about them.<br>
And although they were attempting to arrest him,<br>
they feared the crowds, for they regarded him as a prophet.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,<br>
but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,<br>
"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."<br>
So to them Jesus addressed this parable.<br>
"A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father,<br>
'Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.'<br>
So the father divided the property between them.<br>
After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings<br>
and set off to a distant country<br>
where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.<br>
When he had freely spent everything,<br>
a severe famine struck that country,<br>
and he found himself in dire need.<br>
So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens<br>
who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.<br>
And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed,<br>
but nobody gave him any.<br>
Coming to his senses he thought,<br>
'How many of my father's hired workers<br>
have more than enough food to eat,<br>
but here am I, dying from hunger.<br>
I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,<br>
"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<br>
I no longer deserve to be called your son;<br>
treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers."'<br>
So he got up and went back to his father.<br>
While he was still a long way off,<br>
his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion.<br>
He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.<br>
His son said to him,<br>
'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;<br>
I no longer deserve to be called your son.'<br>
But his father ordered his servants,<br>
'Quickly, bring the finest robe and put it on him;<br>
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<br>
Take the fattened calf and slaughter it.<br>
Then let us celebrate with a feast,<br>
because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again;<br>
he was lost, and has been found.'<br>
Then the celebration began.<br>
Now the older son had been out in the field<br>
and, on his way back, as he neared the house,<br>
he heard the sound of music and dancing.<br>
He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.<br>
The servant said to him,<br>
'Your brother has returned<br>
and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf<br>
because he has him back safe and sound.'<br>
He became angry,<br>
and when he refused to enter the house,<br>
his father came out and pleaded with him.<br>
He said to his father in reply,<br>
'Look, all these years I served you<br>
and not once did I disobey your orders;<br>
yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.<br>
But when your son returns<br>
who swallowed up your property with prostitutes,<br>
for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'<br>
He said to him,<br>
'My son, you are here with me always;<br>
everything I have is yours.<br>
But now we must celebrate and rejoice,<br>
because your brother was dead and has come to life again;<br>
he was lost and has been found.'"</td>

“I, the LORD, am your God, <br>
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.<br>
You shall not have other gods besides me.<br>
You shall not carve idols for yourselves <br>
in the shape of anything in the sky above <br>
or on the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth; <br>
you shall not bow down before them or worship them.<br>

inflicting punishment for their fathers’ wickedness <br>
on the children of those who hate me, <br>
down to the third and fourth generation; <br>
but bestowing mercy down to the thousandth generation <br>
on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments.<br><br>

“You shall not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain.<br>
For the LORD will not leave unpunished <br>
the one who takes his name in vain.<br><br>

“Remember to keep holy the sabbath day.<br>
Six days you may labor and do all your work, <br>
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD, your God.<br>
No work may be done then either by you, or your son or daughter, <br>
or your male or female slave, or your beast, <br>
or by the alien who lives with you.<br>
In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, <br>
the sea and all that is in them; <br>
but on the seventh day he rested.<br>
That is why the LORD has blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.<br><br>

“Honor your father and your mother, <br>
that you may have a long life in the land <br>
which the LORD, your God, is giving you.<br>
You shall not kill.<br>
You shall not commit adultery.<br>
You shall not steal.<br>
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.<br>
You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.<br>
You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, <br>

Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br>
He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, <br>
as well as the money changers seated there.<br>
He made a whip out of cords<br>
and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, <br>
and spilled the coins of the money changers<br>
and overturned their tables, <br>
and to those who sold doves he said,<br>
“Take these out of here, <br>
and stop making my Father’s house a marketplace.”<br>
His disciples recalled the words of Scripture, <br>
Zeal for your house will consume me.<br>
At this the Jews answered and said to him,<br>
“What sign can you show us for doing this?”<br>
Jesus answered and said to them, <br>
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”<br>
The Jews said, <br>
“This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, <br>
and you will raise it up in three days?”<br>
But he was speaking about the temple of his body.<br>
Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, <br>
his disciples remembered that he had said this, <br>
and they came to believe the Scripture <br>
and the word Jesus had spoken.<br><br>

While he was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, <br>
many began to believe in his name <br>
when they saw the signs he was doing.<br>
But Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew them all, <br>
and did not need anyone to testify about human nature.<br>
He himself understood it well.</td>

was highly esteemed and respected by his master,<br>
for through him the LORD had brought victory to Aram.<br>
But valiant as he was, the man was a leper.<br>
Now the Arameans had captured in a raid on the land of Israel<br>
a little girl, who became the servant of Naaman's wife.<br>
"If only my master would present himself to the prophet in Samaria,"<br>
she said to her mistress, "he would cure him of his leprosy."<br>
Naaman went and told his lord<br>
just what the slave girl from the land of Israel had said.<br>
"Go," said the king of Aram.<br>
"I will send along a letter to the king of Israel."<br>
So Naaman set out, taking along ten silver talents,<br>
six thousand gold pieces, and ten festal garments.<br>
To the king of Israel he brought the letter, which read:<br>
"With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you,<br>
that you may cure him of his leprosy."<br><br>

When he read the letter,<br>
the king of Israel tore his garments and exclaimed:<br>
"Am I a god with power over life and death,<br>
that this man should send someone to me to be cured of leprosy?<br>
Take note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!"<br>
When Elisha, the man of God,<br>
heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments,<br>

"Why have you torn your garments?<br>
Let him come to me and find out<br>
that there is a prophet in Israel."<br><br>

"Go and wash seven times in the Jordan,<br>
and your flesh will heal, and you will be clean."<br>
But Naaman went away angry, saying,<br>

and thus cure the leprosy.<br>
Are not the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar,<br>
better than all the waters of Israel?<br>
Could I not wash in them and be cleansed?"<br>
With this, he turned about in anger and left.<br><br>

But his servants came up and reasoned with him.<br>
"My father," they said,<br>
"if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary,<br>
would you not have done it?<br>
All the more now, since he said to you,<br>
'Wash and be clean,' should you do as he said."<br>
So Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times<br>
at the word of the man of God.<br>
His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.<br><br>

He returned with his whole retinue to the man of God.<br>
On his arrival he stood before him and said,<br>
"Now I know that there is no God in all the earth,<br>
except in Israel."

At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,<br>

Moved with compassion the master of that servant<br>
let him go and forgave him the loan.<br>
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants<br>
who owed him a much smaller amount.<br>
He seized him and started to choke him, demanding,<br>
‘Pay back what you owe.’<br>
Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,<br>
‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’<br>
But he refused.<br>
Instead, he had him put in prison<br>
until he paid back the debt.<br>
Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,<br>
they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master<br>
and reported the whole affair.<br>
His master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant!<br>
I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br>
Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant,<br>

Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers<br>

            <td class="aceem">In those days, all the princes of Judah, the priests, and the people<br> 
added infidelity to infidelity, <br>
practicing all the abominations of the nations <br>
and polluting the LORD’s temple <br>
which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.<br><br>

Early and often did the LORD, the God of their fathers, <br>
send his messengers to them, <br>
for he had compassion on his people and his dwelling place.<br>
But they mocked the messengers of God, <br>
despised his warnings, and scoffed at his prophets, <br>
until the anger of the LORD against his people was so inflamed <br>
that there was no remedy.<br>
Their enemies burnt the house of God,<br>
tore down the walls of Jerusalem, <br>
set all its palaces afire, <br>
and destroyed all its precious objects.<br>
Those who escaped the sword were carried captive to Babylon, <br>
where they became servants of the king of the Chaldeans and his sons<br>
until the kingdom of the Persians came to power.<br>
All this was to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah: <br>
“Until the land has retrieved its lost sabbaths, <br>
during all the time it lies waste it shall have rest <br>
while seventy years are fulfilled.”<br><br>

In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, <br>
in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, <br>
the LORD inspired King Cyrus of Persia <br>
to issue this proclamation throughout his kingdom, <br>
both by word of mouth and in writing: <br>
“Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: <br>
All the kingdoms of the earth<br>
the LORD, the God of heaven, has given to me, <br>
and he has also charged me to build him a house <br>
in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.<br>
Whoever, therefore, among you belongs to any part of his people, <br>
let him go up, and may his God be with him!”</td>

God, who is rich in mercy, <br>

“Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, <br>
so must the Son of Man be lifted up, <br>
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”<br><br>

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, <br>
so that everyone who believes in him might not perish <br>
but might have eternal life.<br>
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, <br>
but that the world might be saved through him.<br>
Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, <br>
but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, <br>
because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.<br>
And this is the verdict,<br>
that the light came into the world, <br>
but people preferred darkness to light,<br>
because their works were evil.<br>
For everyone who does wicked things hates the light<br>
and does not come toward the light, <br>
so that his works might not be exposed.<br>
But whoever lives the truth comes to the light, <br>
so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.</td>

Along the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.<br>

"This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah,<br>
and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh.<br>
Wherever the river flows,<br>
every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live,<br>

for they shall be watered by the flow from the sanctuary.<br>
Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine."</td>

a pool called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticoes.<br>
In these lay a large number of ill, blind, lame, and crippled.<br>
One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.<br>
When Jesus saw him lying there<br>

Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your mat, and walk."<br>
Immediately the man became well, took up his mat, and walked.<br><br>
Now that day was a sabbath.<br>
So the Jews said to the man who was cured,<br>
"It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat."<br>
He answered them, "The man who made me well told me,<br>
'Take up your mat and walk.'"<br>
They asked him,<br>
"Who is the man who told you, 'Take it up and walk'?"<br>
The man who was healed did not know who it was,<br>
for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there.<br>
After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him,<br>
"Look, you are well; do not sin any more,<br>
so that nothing worse may happen to you."<br>
The man went and told the Jews<br>
that Jesus was the one who had made him well.<br>
Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus<br>
because he did this on a sabbath.

does not honor the Father who sent him.<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever hears my word<br>

whom you brought out of the land of Egypt,<br>
for they have become depraved.<br>
They have soon turned aside from the way I pointed out to them,<br>
making for themselves a molten calf and worshiping it,<br>
sacrificing to it and crying out,<br>
'This is your God, O Israel,<br>
who brought you out of the land of Egypt!'<br>
The LORD said to Moses,<br>
"I see how stiff-necked this people is.<br>
Let me alone, then,<br>
that my wrath may blaze up against them to consume them.<br>
Then I will make of you a great nation."<br><br>

But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying,<br>
"Why, O LORD, should your wrath blaze up against your own people,<br>
whom you brought out of the land of Egypt<br>
with such great power and with so strong a hand?<br>
Why should the Egyptians say,<br>
'With evil intent he brought them out,<br>
that he might kill them in the mountains<br>
and exterminate them from the face of the earth'?<br>
Let your blazing wrath die down;<br>
relent in punishing your people.<br>
Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel,<br>
and how you swore to them by your own self, saying,<br>
'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky;<br>
and all this land that I promised,<br>
I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'"<br>
So the LORD relented in the punishment<br>
he had threatened to inflict on his people.</td>

            <td class="aceem">In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,<br>
who married a very beautiful and God-fearing woman, Susanna,<br>
the daughter of Hilkiah;<br>
her pious parents had trained their daughter<br>
according to the law of Moses.<br>
Joakim was very rich;<br>
he had a garden near his house,<br>
and the Jews had recourse to him often<br>
because he was the most respected of them all.<br><br>

That year, two elders of the people were appointed judges,<br>
of whom the Lord said, “Wickedness has come out of Babylon:<br>
from the elders who were to govern the people as judges.”<br>
These men, to whom all brought their cases,<br>
frequented the house of Joakim.<br>
When the people left at noon,<br>
Susanna used to enter her husband’s garden for a walk.<br>
When the old men saw her enter every day for her walk,<br>
they began to lust for her.<br>
They suppressed their consciences;<br>
they would not allow their eyes to look to heaven,<br>
and did not keep in mind just judgments.<br><br>

One day, while they were waiting for the right moment,<br>
she entered the garden as usual, with two maids only.<br>
She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br>
Nobody else was there except the two elders,<br>
who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br>
“Bring me oil and soap,” she said to the maids,<br>
“and shut the garden doors while I bathe.”<br><br>

As soon as the maids had left,<br>
the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br>
“Look,” they said, “the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us;<br>
give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br>
If you refuse, we will testify against you<br>
that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.”<br><br>

“I am completely trapped,” Susanna groaned.<br>
“If I yield, it will be my death;<br>
if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br>
Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt<br>
than to sin before the Lord.”<br>
Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br>
as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br>
When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden,<br>
they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br>
At the accusations by the old men,<br>
the servants felt very much ashamed,<br>
for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br><br>

When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day,<br>
the two wicked elders also came,<br>
fully determined to put Susanna to death.<br>
Before all the people they ordered:<br>
“Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah,<br>
the wife of Joakim.”<br>
When she was sent for,<br>
she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br>
All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br><br>

In the midst of the people the two elders rose up<br>
and laid their hands on her head.<br>
Through tears she looked up to heaven,<br>
for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br>
The elders made this accusation:<br>
“As we were walking in the garden alone,<br>
this woman entered with two girls<br>
and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br>
A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br>
When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime,<br>
we ran toward them.<br>
We saw them lying together,<br>
but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we;<br>
he opened the doors and ran off.<br>
Then we seized her and asked who the young man was,<br>
but she refused to tell us.<br>
We testify to this.”<br>
The assembly believed them,<br>
since they were elders and judges of the people,<br>
and they condemned her to death.<br><br>

But Susanna cried aloud:<br>
“O eternal God, you know what is hidden<br>
and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br>
you know that they have testified falsely against me. <br>
Here I am about to die,<br>
though I have done none of the things<br>
with which these wicked men have charged me.”<br><br>

The Lord heard her prayer.<br>
As she was being led to execution,<br>
God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br>
and he cried aloud:<br>
“I will have no part in the death of this woman.”<br>
All the people turned and asked him, “What is this you are saying?”<br>
He stood in their midst and continued,<br>
“Are you such fools, O children of Israel! <br>
To condemn a woman of Israel without examination<br>
and without clear evidence?<br>
Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.”<br><br>

Then all the people returned in haste.<br>
To Daniel the elders said,<br>
“Come, sit with us and inform us,<br>
since God has given you the prestige of old age.”<br>
But he replied,<br>
“Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.”<br><br>

After they were separated one from the other,<br>
he called one of them and said:<br>
“How you have grown evil with age!<br>
Now have your past sins come to term:<br>
passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,<br>
and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,<br>
‘The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.’<br>
Now, then, if you were a witness,<br>
tell me under what tree you saw them together.”<br>
“Under a mastic tree,” he answered.<br>
Daniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you your head,<br>
for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him<br>
and split you in two.”<br>
Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.<br>
Daniel said to him,<br>
“Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you,<br>
lust has subverted your conscience.<br>
This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,<br>
and in their fear they yielded to you;<br>
but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br>
Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.”<br>
“Under an oak,” he said.<br>
Daniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you also your head,<br>
for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two<br>
so as to make an end of you both.”<br><br>

The whole assembly cried aloud,<br>
blessing God who saves those who hope in him.<br>
They rose up against the two elders,<br>
for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.<br>
According to the law of Moses,<br>
they inflicted on them<br>
the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br>
they put them to death.<br>
Thus was innocent blood spared that day.
