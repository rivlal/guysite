            Wherever you are, whatever it is that you do, with the Lord’s presence and His unmerited favor covering you, there is no way you will not be a success. When I started working in my early twenties, I kept on practicing the presence of Jesus and in a short time, became the top salesperson in my company.<br><br>

I not only closed the biggest deals for my company, but I also secured the greatest frequency of sales transactions. I started as one of the lowest-paid employees in the company, but the Lord consistently promoted me, and gave me different income streams from within the same company until I became one of the highest-paid employees in that organization.<br><br>

Please understand that I am not sharing this with you to put a feather in my cap. I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that all the successes that I have experienced in my professional career are a result of Jesus’ presence and unmerited favor in my life.<br><br>

I shared with you about my professional career (before I entered full-time ministry) so that you will not walk away thinking that I have personally experienced good success from the Lord only because I am a pastor. No. Like I mentioned earlier, whatever vocation you are in, you can experience the presence of Jesus and His unmerited favor, and He will make you a success!<br><br>

Whether you are a chef, driver, or consultant, it doesn’t matter. God is on your side to bless and make you a success.<br><br>

Of course, you understand that I am referring to only morally upright professions. You cannot depend on God’s unmerited favor if you are in an industry that requires you to compromise on your Christian morals.<br><br>

If you are involved in a morally corrupt industry or a job that expects you to lie, cheat, or deceive, my advice to you is to get out! You do not have to depend on a job that puts you in a morally compromising position for your income. God loves you intimately and He has something so much better in store for you. Trust Him.<br><br>

God is here to save you from destroying yourself. He wants to give you good success and He loves you too much to see you remain in a job that forces you to compromise. The Bible says, “A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, loving favor rather than silver and gold” (Proverbs 22:1).<br><br>

God has a higher way and better plan for your life. You can walk in it today by depending on His unmerited favor to provide for and prosper you!

          Do you sometimes feel like you are just a face in a crowd or a number in a system? You are identified by your social security number. Even when you see the doctor, you are called by your queue number. If you feel depersonalized and dehumanized, that is exactly how the devil wants you to feel—that you do not matter much to anyone, especially to God.<br><br>

But you do matter to God! He calls you by name. He knows exactly what you are going through and where you are hurting. He sees you and cares for you, just as He cared for the people when He first walked on earth.<br><br>

My friend, He will do for you what He did for the woman in Samaria. The Bible says that “He needed to go through Samaria” to get from Judea to Galilee (John 4:4).<br><br>

Now, any Jew of His day would have taken a different and longer route to avoid going through Samaria because they hated the Samaritans, though the way through Samaria would have taken much less time. But Jesus deliberately took the shorter, avoided route, just so He could stop by Samaria to speak to the woman who had been searching for something in her life to satisfy her.<br><br>

This woman had had five husbands and the man she was living with was not her husband. Clearly, things had not been going right in her life. She was probably looking for answers and fulfillment, and must have felt ashamed about her failed marriages and current lifestyle.<br><br>

Yet, in spite of all this, she mattered to Jesus! He needed to go to her to minister to her. And indeed, after she met Jesus, the perfect Man, she was transformed. She was no longer ashamed, and went into the city to tell the people about Him (John 4:28–29).<br><br>

Beloved, Jesus wants to meet you wherever you are at in life and minister His grace to you. You certainly matter to Him. He came to give you life and life more abundantly (John 10:10).<br><br>

You are not just a face in a crowd or a number. No, He knows you by name and has a personal love for you. And in spite of the mess that you might be in, He wants to meet your every need and make your life beautiful!

            The devil doesn’t want you to be strong in the Lord’s love for you. Instead, he wants you to question God’s love for you. To accomplish this, one of his key strategies is to try to make you think that God is mad at you.<br><br>

God’s Word tells us that the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. This means that he cannot just devour anyone. He must look for those whom he can devour.<br><br>

Some of us are “undevourable.” There may not be such a word, but it certainly describes a great place to be when the enemy is on the prowl for his next victim.<br><br>

My friend, you can become “undevourable” to the devil. The secret is found in the preceding verse, “casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).<br><br>

Can you see it? The secret to being “undevourable” is to be carefree and not be bogged down by anxieties and worries! It is to laugh a lot, enjoy your life, and to take no thought for tomorrow.<br><br>

To the legalistic mind, this sounds terribly irresponsible. However, in God’s mind, your greatest responsibility is to rejoice in the Lord always and to not worry about your past failures, your present circumstances, and your future challenges!<br><br>

Why? It’s because of what God’s grace has already done for you. And it’s because the One who has the power over death is caring for you and watching over you right this minute.<br><br>

If you want to see victory over the enemy’s attacks, then learn to relax, to let go, and to release every oppressive thought, worry, and care into Jesus’ loving hands. Believe with all your heart that He cares for you and that you are not alone in this journey. You have a constant companion in Jesus on this great adventure called life.<br><br>

Note that the devil walks about like a roaring lion. The devil is an impostor who tries to intimidate you through the impression that God is angry with you.<br><br>

Let’s be clear here: there is only one true lion and that is the Lion of Judah, Jesus Christ (Revelation 5:5), the King of kings, and He is not mad at you today. His wrath is directed at anything that seeks to destroy you. You are not the object of His wrath; you are the object of His love.<br><br>

So be strong in His love for you. That’s how you resist the devil who will have no choice but to flee from you!

         I want to encourage you to make listening to the good news of Jesus a daily priority. Listen, I know just how crazy and busy our days can get. But when the day is over and we have heard nothing about Jesus, we feel empty, stressed out, worried, fearful, and depressed.<br><br>

My friend, Jesus is the bread of life and the living water. No matter how busy we get, it is prudent not to neglect feeding on His person. I know that in the natural, this can sound simplistic. You may be asking yourself, “How can simply listening about Jesus change things in my life and circumstances?”<br><br>

The truth is, the things of God are really not complicated. Just think about the woman who suffered from hemorrhaging for twelve years. Simply hearing about Jesus and His grace infused her with so much hope, so much faith, and so much courage that she was able to receive the healing she had started to believe for. Don’t underestimate the power of hearing about Jesus just because it sounds simple.<br><br>

There is a beautiful verse in the psalms that says, “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (Psalms 90:12). Do you want to know the secret of numbering your days and not allowing a single day of your life to be put to waste? The key is found in verse 14, where it says, “Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy.” The word “mercy” here is the Hebrew word hesed, which means God’s grace. God is telling us to be satisfied every day with His grace.<br><br>

I suggest that before you do anything—read the papers, check your emails, or make that important phone call—start the day with Jesus and be satisfied with His grace. You can read a devotional about God’s grace, feed on the Father’s love, meditate on His grace, listen to a message that is all about Jesus, and open up His love letter—His Word—to you.<br><br>

But Pastor Prince, my mornings are crazy! How long do I spend doing this?<br><br>

How much must I read, listen, or pray?<br><br>

Beloved, the key is not to be legalistic about it. If morning doesn’t work for you, then find a time that best suits your schedule. It could be during your lunch break or just before you go to bed. The key principle here is to be satisfied daily with His grace. Feed on Him until your heart is full and satisfied with His grace. It’s really not about the duration or how much, but your level of satisfaction.<br><br>

Enjoy God’s presence daily. He loves having a relationship with you and wants to fill your heart with His grace, peace, wisdom, and joy.

But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.”</i><br>Mark 5:30–34</font></strong><br><br>
            In the healing of the woman with the issue of blood, you could say that the woman sneaked up behind Jesus and “stole” her healing! But was Jesus offended? Not at all! In fact, He was so pleased with her boldness that He just had to meet her.<br><br>

Jesus did not seek her out to rebuke her. No, He sought her out so that He could affirm her with His love and assure her that He wasn’t angry with her for having taken a portion of healing virtue from Him. That’s why He even called her “daughter” and encouraged her to walk in her healing—“Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.”<br><br>

Beloved, that’s the heart of your Savior. He freely gives out His healing virtue to anyone who will take it from Him. So reach out and take from Him right now and bring pleasure to His heart!

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, “Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!”. . . Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that same hour.</i><br>Matthew 8:10, 13</font></strong><br><br>
          Do you know that there were only two people in the Bible whom Jesus said had “great faith”? The first was the Roman centurion whose servant was healed by Jesus’ word (Matthew 8:5–13). The second was the Syro-Phoenician woman, whose demon-possessed daughter was also healed by Jesus (Matthew 15:21–28). I encourage you to take a minute and read both accounts from your Bible right now, before proceeding with the rest of today’s reading.<br><br>

As I was reading these two accounts one night, the Lord said to me, “Son, look for the common denominator between these two people and you will discover the secret to great faith.”<br><br>

I had always thought that the secret to the centurion’s great faith was that he understood authority. Because he was a military man of authority, he thus understood the authority of the Lord Jesus. But that does not apply to the woman, who was probably a homemaker. So what’s the common denominator to their great faith?<br><br>

After I had tried to figure it out for a while, the Lord said to me, “Both were Gentiles. They were not Jews. Neither of them were under the law of Moses, and therefore they did not disqualify themselves. They were not under condemnation by the law, and so they could have great faith to receive from Me.”<br><br>

Wow, what a powerful revelation! They were both not under the law, which is the opposite of faith, that’s why they could have great faith!<br><br>

The Bible itself plainly says that “the law is not of faith” (Galatians 3:12). And in another place it says, “For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect” (Romans 4:14).<br><br>

You see, the law will disqualify people from receiving any blessing from the Lord. It is only faith in His grace that qualifies God’s people and stirs up great faith unconsciously to receive what they need from the Lord. This is the secret to having great faith for any situation in your life!<br><br>

I see this so clearly in the experience of Naomi who lives in South Africa. She became unemployed and was left with no place to stay, having been rejected by her family. She and her son ended up finding shelter in a village with a poor family in deplorable conditions, sometimes eating food taken out of dustbins. Despite extreme hardship, she wrote:<br><br>

I truly believed that the Lord was in full control of my life and that things were in the process of changing. Through it all, I chose to put all my faith in God, knowing that He would restore and change my life. I knew that God loved me and that it hurt Him to see me go through all of this. I also knew that He would bring to pass what He had promised in His Word.<br><br>

During that period, I fed on God’s Word and His grace and chose to focus on the many blessings I was already enjoying— health, joy, peace, and having Jesus in my life. A year later, the Lord blessed me with a good job, a car, a home, and a wonderful man who is also madly in love with Jesus. My son also sleeps peacefully now. We are sold out to Jesus and the gospel of grace, sharing it wherever we go.<br><br>

Here is the key to Naomi’s faith. She said, “Thank you, Pastor Prince, for revealing the beauty of our Lord Jesus in such a simple but powerful way. It just made me fall in love with Jesus.”<br><br>

My friend, the more you see Jesus—His beauty and His finished work of grace—the more faith arises in your heart. You will have unconscious faith to believe what God’s Word says about you and to ask boldly of Him. It’s truly all about Jesus, seeing His love, and allowing Him to love you and be gracious to you!

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>“What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’”</i><br>Luke 15:4–6</font></strong><br><br>
            Do you remember the parable of the lost sheep Jesus told in Luke 15? When the shepherd found the lost sheep, he lifted it up and laid it upon his strong shoulders. What did the sheep do? Nothing. It just consented to be rescued by the shepherd.<br><br>

Jesus calls this consent on the part of the sheep “repentance”—“there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance” (Luke 15:7).<br><br>

That is what God invites us to do today—to consent to be protected. He wants us to be on His shoulders, in the safety of Himself as our impenetrable fortress. In this place, no predator can attack His sheep.<br><br>

On His shoulders, you are highly exalted above all your troubles, above all danger, all attacks, and far above all principalities and powers. Yes, far above Satan, above all the powers of darkness and the snare of the fowler. On His shoulders, you are far above every sickness, disease, and every name that is named. What a great place to be!<br><br>

And does the Lord do this grudgingly? Absolutely not. The Bible tells us that the shepherd lays the sheep on his shoulders “rejoicing” (Luke 15:5). Our Lord rescues us with great joy in His heart and a big smile on His face.<br><br>

Beloved, the safest place you can be today is on His shoulders. Jesus is your city of refuge. In your day of trouble, run to Him!<br><br>

I pray you’ll anchor your heart on the wonderful verse that encapsulates this: “The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him, who shelters him all the day long; and he shall dwell between His shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12).<br><br>

When you make the Lord your refuge and dwelling place, you shall dwell safely in Him and no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling!

          Did you know that Jesus came to reveal only one name of God to us? Our Lord Jesus came to reveal the name “Father.”<br><br>

Father speaks of family and of closeness and intimacy. You can know God as Elyon, the Most High. As El Shaddai, God Almighty. As Yehovah, the Lord, the covenant-keeping God. As Elohim, mighty Creator of the heavens and the earth.<br><br>

Every name is so significant as each one reveals a wonderful aspect of our God. But when you know God as Father, all His virtues, attributes, and power work for you to set you on high and deliver you.<br><br>

Our Lord Jesus prayed, “Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are” (John 17:11). The Greek word for “keep” here is the word tereo, which means to attend to carefully, to take care of, to guard, to watch, and to preserve.<br><br>

What is the name through which you will be kept guarded and protected? FATHER. Beloved, I want you to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you have a heavenly Father who loves you, who gave up His all for you, and who is vigilantly watching over you!<br><br>

He is your Father. Your Daddy. Your Abba.<br><br>

That is the name by which He wants you to call Him. When my son, Justin, has a nightmare, he doesn’t call out, “Pastor Prince!” He just cries out, “Abba!” and I am there, ready to take on any monsters hiding under his bed.<br><br>

In the same way, you can have complete assurance that when you call upon your Father, He will answer you. You can have full confidence in your Father’s protection and deliverance for you and your family, not because of your love for Him, but because of His love for you.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there. The LORD was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</i><br>Genesis 39:1–2</font></strong><br><br>
            Would you consider the young man Joseph, who was about to be sold into slavery, “a successful man”?<br><br>

Of course not!<br><br>

Yet, God says in His own words that Joseph was a successful man.<br><br>

God’s definition of success is contrary to the world’s definition. Corporate America measures success based on what you have done, what you have accomplished, and what you have accumulated. It is based entirely on you focusing all your time, energy, and resources in meriting titles and collecting accomplishments.<br><br>

My friend, I want to encourage you to begin to see that the world’s model of success is unstable and built upon a foundation that is shakable. It may have the appearance of the good life, but it is temporal, and we have all seen for ourselves how the world’s transient wealth can dissipate like smoke and easily slip away like the shifting sands in the desert.<br><br>

From Genesis 39:2, it is clear that success is not what you have, but rather who you have! Joseph literally had nothing materially, but at the same time, he had everything because the Lord was with him.<br><br>

The material things that you have accumulated or are feverishly trying to amass do not make you a success. It is the presence of the Lord in your life that makes you a success!<br><br>

We need to learn to stop pursuing things and to start pursuing Him. God sees your relationship with Him as the only thing that you need for every success in your life.<br><br>

I can’t imagine starting in a worse place than Joseph. He was completely naked. He had nothing! No bank accounts, no educational qualifications, no natural connections with people of influence, nothing.<br><br>

Thank God the Bible records a picture of Joseph who began with nothing, so that you and I can have hope today. If you think that like Joseph, you have nothing, well, you can start believing in the power of the presence of the Lord in your life. Start looking to Jesus and claim that promise in that scripture for yourself!<br><br>

Say, “The Lord is with ME, and I am a successful person.”<br><br>

Say it a hundred times if you have to, and begin to see this as your reality. Stick this promise on your mirror, and every morning when you brush your teeth, remind yourself that today, as you go to work, as you go to school, as you start the day caring for your children at home (or do whatever it is that you need to do), the Lord is with you.<br><br>

And because He is with you, YOU ARE ALREADY A SUCCESS! When you have Jesus in your life, you are no longer trying to be a success; you ARE a success!

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, “The man who does those things shall live by them.” But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way . . . “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</i><br>Romans 10:4–6, 8–10</font></strong><br><br>
          Let’s take a moment to examine today’s scripture and what the apostle Paul says about the power of speaking in the new covenant of grace. In this passage, you see the differences that he skillfully laid out for us between the old and new covenants.<br><br>

Christ marks the end of the law and the beginning of the new covenant. It is the gift of righteousness versus righteousness by works. Faith versus works. Believing versus working. Speaking versus doing.<br><br>

It is vital for you to recognize the differences between the two covenants. You see, the new covenant is about right believing, whereas the old covenant was about right doing. The new covenant is about the power of speaking well, whereas the old covenant was about the power of working well.<br><br>

I believe in the power of right believing. When a person believes right, he will live right. When a person believes that he is made righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ, he will be inwardly transformed to live right, and the spirit of godliness will be evident in his life.<br><br>

He won’t just be outwardly fulfilling the letter of the law for fear of punishment with a heart that is not right. The grace revolution is about inside-out transformation. It is about a heart emancipated by grace.<br><br>

A person transformed by grace not only keeps the law of God outwardly, but His heart is also full of Jesus. He overflows with generosity, he is passionate for his spouse, and he is zealous for good works and the glory of His Savior, Jesus Christ. See the difference? It’s like night and day.<br><br>

Your words are powerful. The Bible says that the word of faith is near you, “in your mouth and in your heart” (Romans 10:8). Notice that it is first in your mouth, and then it drops into your heart.<br><br>

When you speak words of faith, what you speak will finally drop into your heart, and what is in your heart will lead you. So when you are sick, speak well over yourself, declaring, “Lord Jesus, I thank You that by Your stripes I am healed.”<br><br>

It is important that under the new covenant you are not working for your own righteousness in order to be healed and blessed. Moses says this of the righteousness that is by the law: “The man who does those things shall live by them” (Romans 10:5). The focus is on doing.<br><br>

What about the righteousness that is of the new covenant? According to Romans 10:6, “the righteousness of faith speaks.” The focus is on speaking. Therefore, speak! Open your mouth and speak! Faith (believing) is released by speaking.<br><br>

You and I are made in the image of God, who, when things were very dark at the beginning of creation, didn’t say, “Wow, it is so terribly dark here!” He didn’t speak about the darkness. He did not speak what He saw.<br><br>

No, God spoke forth what He wanted to see. He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light (Genesis 1:3–4). God saw light after He spoke it. When Abram was still childless, God changed his name to Abraham, which means “father of many nations” (Genesis 17:5). When the man with the withered hand met our Lord Jesus, Jesus spoke the word, asking the man to stretch out his hand, and the man was completely healed (Matthew 12:10–13).<br><br>

With physical eyes, man saw Abram as barren and the man with the withered hand as an invalid. But our Lord saw and spoke differently! We serve a God “who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did” (Romans 4:17).

I love the King James translation, which says our God is a God “who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.” He quickened the dead and brought nonexistent things into existence with His spoken words!<br><br>

You are made in His image. The same can and will happen for you when you see and speak what you believe and want to see!

            Do you believe that Jesus is interested in your success?<br><br>

Take a moment to reflect on this.<br><br>

My friend, I want you to know that Jesus delights in blessing you. It is His good pleasure to see you blessed in every area of your life!<br><br>

Now, don’t put a limit on His blessings in your life. The blessings of the Lord are not (as some may erroneously believe) just seen in material things.<br><br>

Jesus is infinitely interested in your total well-being. He is interested in your family, career, fulfillment in life, marriage, ministry, and boy, does the list go on!<br><br>

When it comes to your desires, hopes, and dreams, there is no detail that is too minuscule, minute, or insignificant for Jesus. Trust me, if it matters to you, it matters to Him!<br><br>

Even if you go to Him in prayer to remove that small pimple on your nose, He is not going to look at you and reply mockingly, “Hey buddy, don’t you know that I’ve got a whole universe to run? Come to Me when you have a bigger prayer request.”<br><br>

No way! A thousand times no! Jesus will never ridicule or deride your concerns as petty. He is never dismissive or condescending. He is not like some of your so-called “friends,” who may delight in poking fun at your shortcomings. If it bothers you, it “bothers” Him.<br><br>

You are important to Jesus. Know with full assurance in your heart that Jesus knows you perfectly, and yet accepts and loves you perfectly. When you begin to understand that, you will realize that it is truly that unmerited favor, that favor from Jesus that you know you do not deserve, did not merit, and cannot earn for yourself, that will perfect every imperfection and weakness in your life.<br><br>

If you are facing challenges, such as lack in any area, addictions, fears, sicknesses, or broken relationships, Jesus’ unmerited favor will protect, deliver, prosper, bring restoration to, and provide for you. His unmerited favor will transform you into wholeness, and it is the goodness of God, not your striving and self-efforts, that will lead you to live victoriously for His glory.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>If God is for us, who can be against us?</i><br>Romans 8:31</font></strong><br><br>
          Romans 8:31 contains a powerful rhetorical question and I encourage you to memorize it. Unfortunately, there are still some believers today wondering, “Is God really for me?”<br><br>

Well, my friend, the Word of God does NOT say “maybe God is for us” or “hopefully, God is for us.” It simply says, “If God is for us, who can be against us?”<br><br>

Indeed, when God is for you, what opposition can succeed against you? When God Himself fights for you, defends you, and vindicates you, what adversity or adversary can stand against you? There are none! Hallelujah!<br><br>

“But Pastor Prince, how did God come to be on our side? Even though I am a Christian today, I still fail and fall short of God's holy standards. I still lose my temper on the road now and then, and from time to time, I still get angry with my wife and kids. Why should God be on my side when I fail? Don’t you know that God’s holy?”<br><br>

All great questions. Let me tell you why God is on our side. The answer is found at the cross. The blood that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, shed on the cross put God on your side. Today, God can be for you even when you fail because Jesus’ blood has washed you whiter than snow!<br><br>

Have you seen Cecil DeMille’s movie, The Ten Commandments, or the animation, The Prince Of Egypt? Do you remember what happened on the night of the Passover? The children of Israel put the blood of the lamb on their doorposts.<br><br>

What did the blood do? The blood put God on their side! None of the families who had applied blood on their doorposts had to fear the death of their firstborn children.<br><br>

Now, think about this for a moment. Were the firstborn children of Israel spared that night because of their perfect behavior and conduct, or were they spared because of the blood of the lamb? Of course, it was because of the blood of the lamb!<br><br>

In the same way, God does not bless you, as a new covenant believer, based on your perfect behavior and conduct. He is for you today because of the blood of the perfect Lamb—Jesus Christ.<br><br>

That is why as believers today, we don’t have to fight for ourselves. I like to say it this way: “If God is for us, who can come successfully against us?”<br><br>

Always remember that God is on your side today because of Jesus’ blood. His holiness and righteousness that men are afraid of are now on your side because of Jesus’ blood. His unmerited favor is on your side and all of heaven’s resources are yours because of Jesus’ blood!<br><br>

Now, who can come successfully against you? No sickness, no disease, no creditor, no evil accusation, no gossip—no weapon formed against you, can come successfully against you (Isaiah 54:17)!

            Jesus was the apple of God’s eye. He was God’s darling Son, His infinite joy and delight.<br><br>

Yet, God gave Jesus up for you. That’s how much God loves you.<br><br>

Just think about it: If you knew you could save a dying person by giving up something precious to you, would you go as far as to give up your only child whom you dearly love for that person?<br><br>

Yet, that is exactly what God did to save you. Jesus, His beloved Son, died on the cross to cleanse you, heal you, and redeem you—spirit, soul, and body! That is how precious you are to God!

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you."</i><br>Genesis 41:39–40</font></strong><br><br>
          In Genesis 39:3–4, we see how when Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph, and that everything he touched prospered, Potiphar immediately promoted Joseph and placed him in charge over all the affairs of his house. Similarly, when Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in Joseph and that there was none who was as wise and as discerning as Joseph, Pharaoh placed him in charge of the whole of Egypt (Genesis 41:38–41).<br><br>

My friend, I want you to note this: Joseph knew that God was the source of his wisdom. When Pharaoh said, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it,” Joseph immediately replied, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace” (Genesis 41:15–16).<br><br>

Joseph knew that his wisdom was a result of the Lord’s unmerited favor and would not take any credit for it. Clearly, here was a man who understood grace, and could be trusted with increase, promotion, and more good success.<br><br>

Observe the wisdom of Joseph in action. Joseph did not just interpret Pharaoh’s dream. He went on to advise Pharaoh on how to take advantage of the seven years of abundance to prepare for the seven years of famine that were revealed in his dream. Did you notice how Joseph’s wise advice led to the creation of a position of influence for himself?<br><br>

That is how the wisdom of the Lord operates. Proverbs 18:16 says, “A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.” Joseph knew that his wisdom was a gift from the Lord. He knew that he did not earn it and that it flowed from the Lord’s unmerited favor toward him.<br><br>

The Lord’s ways are amazing. See the extent of Joseph’s promotion in Genesis 41. In the space of less than an hour, he rose from a lowly prisoner to the highest possible office in all of Egypt. That, my friend, is the unmerited favor of God! No striving, no self-effort, no compromises, and no manipulation, just pure grace and grace alone made all the difference in Joseph’s life!<br><br>

Remember that when the Lord is with you, you are a successful person. It may feel like you are in a prison now, stuck in a hopeless situation, cast away and forgotten like Joseph was, but the story is not over yet! The Lord’s promotion is around the corner. Whatever situation you are in right now, do not give up.<br><br>

If you are caught in a situation where you don’t know what to do, it is time to humble yourself and ask the Lord for wisdom. The Bible says, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).<br><br>

To ask the Lord for wisdom is to say, “I can’t, Lord, but You can. I give up on my own efforts and depend entirely upon your unmerited favor and wisdom.” As you receive His wisdom, riches and honor, as well as long life, will follow after you (Proverbs 3:16). Run to Him right now!

            I like how the King James Version translates Ruth 2:3: “and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz” (boldface mine). The Hebrew word for “to come to” and “to light on” is qarah. And the Hebrew word for “happened” and “hap” is miqreh, which comes from the word qarah.<br><br>

Incidentally, the word happy comes from the old English word “hap,” which is why when happenings happen the way you want them to happen, you are happy!<br><br>

I don’t know how many times I have heard testimonies from people who happened to meet an old friend in need and were able to minister to the friend, or who happened to have been delayed or who happened to change their original plans and, because of that, were protected from danger.<br><br>

My friend, none of those things happened by accident or coincidence. It was the Lord giving them eth and qarah—putting them at the right place at the right time!<br><br>

This is reflected in a praise report from Sandy, who lives in Singapore.<br><br>

Before I drive, I always make it a point to pray for protection. On March 31, I prayed as usual before I started driving toward the city.<br><br>
I got stuck in heavy traffic and the cars were inching forward toward a major traffic junction. Like many motorists, I got impatient and was disappointed when the traffic light turned red just as I was approaching the junction. Then, I heard a strange sound of something cracking, and I was shocked as a huge old tree fell and hit the roof of the car right in front of me, creating a huge dent in its roof and shattering the rear windscreen.<br><br>
By God’s grace, the driver of the car emerged unscathed. Needless to say, I was very grateful to God when I realized that He had placed me at the right place at the right time so that I wasn’t hurt.<br><br>
I am very thankful to Jesus for His divine protection. Without His wings of protection over me, I may not even be alive today. Thank You, Jesus!<br><br>
Even with something as mundane as driving on the road, which many of us do every day, we need to make it a point to pray for the Lord’s protection. Let’s not put our trust in our daily routines, our skills, or our limited ability to foresee danger. Our trust must be in the Lord’s protection.

She was presented with two options: immediate surgery to remove the tumor (the risk of surgery being a 20 percent failure rate and the possibility of going blind in one eye) or medication. She was told that if she decided on medication, it would take a long time to work, with most tumors shrinking only after a year or so. This is Connie’s story:<br><br>

Pastor Prince, what the doctors said about the tumor was devastating news to me and my family. I remember telling myself that if I were to lose my eyesight, I would not want to live anymore.<br><br>

It was during this time that my family resolved to commit the whole thing to God, to trust and rely on Him entirely and pray for healing. We opted to go with taking medication.<br><br>

Despite wanting to believe in God’s love and goodness toward me, I was constantly plagued with questions such as, “Does God love me anymore? Does He even care? Is He punishing me for something wrong that I’ve done? Should I just grit my teeth and accept the situation?”<br><br>

It was only when a colleague and friend at my workplace started passing me your sermon CDs to listen to that I was reminded once again of my Savior’s love, grace, and goodness toward me. I believe that as I listened to the Word preached via the CDs, my body began healing.<br><br>

Within a month of the medication, the level of prolactin in my blood decreased and the balance of chemicals in my body became stable. After two more months, the MRI scan showed that the tumor had shrunk to half its original size. I was very encouraged and, most importantly, I felt confident and secure that my God was doing His work of healing in my body, that He loves and cares for me enough to know that I was hurting and to do something about it.<br><br>

The best news came when the MRI scan showed that the macro-tumor was GONE! The doctor was amazed and kept saying that in most cases, even when a tumor had shrunk by so much, there would still be remnants of tumor cells. But in my case, the tumor was completely GONE, with no trace of any tumor cells at all!<br><br>

No words can describe how grateful and thankful I am to God. I know that it is God who has healed me. But what’s more important is the fact that I stand tall as a child of God, and I know that I am the righteousness of God because of what Jesus has done on the cross for me. Knowing that I am deeply loved and cared for by God makes me so secure in my relationship with God.<br><br>

I want to give all the glory and praise to God. I am what I am today—healed, whole, and at peace—only because of the preaching of the gospel of grace!<br><br>

My friend, if Connie had believed that God was punishing her for some sin, she would have just gritted her teeth, accepted her sickness as punishment, and never sought God for healing. But praise God that He brought light into Connie’s situation and showed her how much He loved her!<br><br>

If you want to see the power of God’s grace operating in every dimension of your life, I challenge you to believe in His love, His gift of righteousness, and His forgiveness. There is power to heal now if you would turn to and rest in His finished work and in His love for you. His love never fails!

            God wants us to go after wisdom. Wisdom is the “principal thing”, He tells us. We are not to go after riches.<br><br>

But when we have wisdom, all the things we seek will follow after us, including honor and length of days. So never make riches your goal!<br><br>

My friend, if you lack wisdom, simply ask God for it. He will give it to you “liberally and without reproach” (James 1:5). The truth is that He has already given you wisdom when He gave you Jesus, “who became for us wisdom from God” (1 Corinthians 1:30).<br><br>

So if you are facing a challenge at work and you don’t know how to resolve it, say, “Jesus, You are my wisdom. I thank You that You will provide me with the best solution.” If you have a wayward child, say, “Jesus, thank You for wisdom in loving and raising this child well.”<br><br>

Beloved, you are most blessed to have Jesus, in whom resides all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge!

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</i><br>Matthew 3:16–17</font></strong><br><br>
         After Jesus’ baptism, the Holy Spirit led Him into the wilderness, and the devil came to tempt Him saying, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread” (Matthew 4:3).<br><br>

Many years ago when I was studying this, the Lord opened my eyes and showed me that the devil had subtly left out the word “beloved.” Just moments ago, God the Father had just affirmed Jesus as His beloved Son at the Jordan River. However, when the devil came to tempt Jesus, he removed the word “beloved” and simply said, “If You are the Son of God . . .”<br><br>

The Lord unveiled to me that if you are reminded that you are the beloved of the Father, you can never be successfully tempted! Even the devil knew this, and that’s why he removed the word “beloved” when he spoke to Jesus. Now that’s a powerful truth!<br><br>

So every time you are tempted, just remind yourself, “I am God’s beloved child, and my Father loves me.” No temptation can triumph over you when you rest securely in your Father’s love.<br><br>

Now observe Jesus’ reply. He didn’t have to prove to the devil that He was the Son of God. Secure in His identity as God’s beloved Son, He simply replied, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” (Matthew 4:4). And what words had the Father just said at the Jordan River? “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”<br><br>

I want to encourage you to personalize this and meditate on it every day! That’s how the Father sees you today. He sees you in Christ, and in Christ you are His precious, beloved child, in whom He is well pleased. Place your hand on your heart and hear your Father in heaven saying these words to you:<br><br>

“You are My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.”<br><br>

Would you believe that with all your heart today? If you are struggling to overcome a disorder or addiction, close your eyes and hear your Father saying to you, “You are My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.” Every time you are fearful, every time you are consumed by worry, anger, or depression, hear your Father saying to you, “You are My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.”<br><br>

Yes, right in the midst of whatever failures you may be experiencing, you are His beloved child, and He is well pleased with you because you are in Christ. Keep hearing it and repeating it until you find rest, peace, and joy overflowing in your heart.<br><br>

If you feel like just crying in His presence, cry. He knows what you are going through and He understands—in a way that no one else can—the pain, hurt, suffering, and loss that you are experiencing. Let His perfect love cast out every fear and bring healing and wholeness to your heart.

            What are your eyes fixed on today? Are they focused on the darkness that is in the world? Or are they fixed on the Lord’s promises for your life?<br><br>

My chief intention here is to turn your eyes away from the destruction you see every day, and to turn them to our beautiful Lord Jesus.<br><br>

Do you know what Caleb’s secret to long life was? The passage above tells us that it was found in simply following the Lord. Hebron was the name for one of the cities of refuge in the Bible. In Hebrew, “Hebron” means fellowship or association. This speaks of intimacy, closeness, and connection with the Lord.<br><br>

There is no formula to long life. It's all about having an intimate relationship with Jesus. Our Lord Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. He came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. Follow Him and find the path to a long and abundant life.<br><br>

Don’t forget that everything Caleb experienced was under the old covenant. His renewal of youth and unabated strength and vigor were all experienced under the old covenant. How much more should we be experiencing this renewal of youth, boundless energy, and length of days under the new covenant of grace that is established on better promises (Hebrews 8:6)!<br><br>

In a psalm that Moses wrote, it says, “The days of our lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years” (Psalms 90:10). Some people have used this to teach that our expected lifespan is therefore between seventy and eighty years.<br><br>

But it is important we interpret this psalm in the context of the children of Israel being in the wilderness and under God’s wrath. We have also seen that even under the old covenant, Caleb transcended this lifespan and was still going strong at eighty-five years old.<br><br>

So dear reader—you who are under the new covenant—I encourage you to aim high. Don’t settle for living till just seventy or eighty years old, when God has promised, “With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation” (Psalms 91:16).

Your satisfaction is the limit and according to your faith, be it unto you. I pray that as you stay close to our Lord Jesus, you will live long, live strong, and live under the protective covering of His wings.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>A heart at peace gives life to the body.</i><br>Proverbs 14:30</font></strong><br><br>
          The best way to know if you are embroiled in the things of the world is to be objective and ask yourself this: “Is my heart troubled?” I believe that the number one killer in the modern world is stress.<br><br>

Medical doctors in my church have told me that if a patient has high blood pressure, they can advise the patient to cut down on sodium. They can also advise their patients to cut down on other excesses such as sugar or cholesterol. But as doctors, there is one thing that they cannot control in their patients, and that is their patients’ stress levels.<br><br>

I personally believe that the physical root cause of many medical conditions today is stress. Stress can produce all kinds of imbalances in your body. It can cause you to age prematurely, give you rashes, cause gastric pains, and even lead to abnormal growths in your body.<br><br>

To put it succinctly, stress kills! Doctors tell us that certain physical symptoms are “psychosomatic” in nature. That’s because these symptoms are brought about by psychological problems such as stress. Stress is not from God. Peace is from Him!<br><br>

I trust that you are beginning to understand why Jesus said, “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:27).<br><br>

Now, Jesus would not have used the word “peace.” The Greek New Testament renders “peace” as eirene, but since Jesus spoke Aramaic-Hebrew, He would have used the word “shalom”—“Shalom I leave with you, My shalom I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”<br><br>

In the Hebrew vernacular, “shalom” is a very rich and loaded word. There is no English word that can accurately encapsulate the fullness, richness, and power contained in the word “shalom.” Hence, English Bible translators were only able to translate it as “peace.”<br><br>

But while the word “shalom” includes peace, it means so much more. Let’s look at the Brown Driver & Briggs Hebrew Lexicon to get a better idea of what Jesus meant when He said, “Shalom I leave with you.”<br><br>

The Hebrew Lexicon describes “shalom” as completeness, safety, soundness (in body), welfare, health, prosperity, peace, quiet, tranquility, contentment, peace used of human relationships, peace with God especially in our covenant relationship, and peace from war. Wow, what a powerful word!<br><br>

This is the shalom that Jesus has bequeathed you: His completeness, His safety, His soundness, His welfare, His health, His prosperity, His peace, His quietness, His tranquility, His contentment, His peace in human relationships, His peace with God through the covenant made at the cross, and His peace from war. All these, my friend, are part of your inheritance in Christ today!<br><br>

Can you picture the full implications of what it means to experience Jesus’ shalom in your life? Can you picture your life being free from regrets, anxieties, and worries? How healthy, vibrant, energetic, and strong you will be! Thank the Lord for this blessing today and start enjoying His shalom in every area of your life.

            The Bible tells us that God has made us “accepted in the Beloved.” The Beloved here refers to Jesus and the word “accepted” means “given special honor” or “highly favored.”<br><br>

My friend, because you have Jesus who is God’s Beloved, and you are found in Him, you are also God’s beloved son or daughter, deeply loved and highly favored by Him!<br><br>

Now, because you are highly favored by God in the Beloved, you can expect to have favor with your spouse, children, colleagues, clients, and yes, even your in-laws! When you speak, people listen. When you step into a room, it lights up. Everything you touch is blessed and increased.<br><br>

Beloved, as the apple of God’s eye, expect good things to happen to you each day. Expect divine protection because His favor surrounds you like a shield. Expect every need to be met by the One who highly favors you. Expect good, because you are precious in His eyes!

         Today, we are beneficiaries of God’s favor because His wrath against our sins has already been completely satisfied at Calvary. In Hebrew, the word used for “favor” is ratsown, which means His pleasure, delight, goodwill, and acceptance.<br><br>

Our place of protection was purchased with the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Him, we have been made righteous, and all the blessings of the righteous, including protection, provision, and length of days, are our inheritance. That’s the place we are in today. Isn’t that beautiful?<br><br>

No wonder the Scriptures tell us, “The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion” (Proverbs 28:1). It also tells us, “The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much” (James 5:16). A righteous man (or woman) is who you are in Christ, and when you pray the prayer of protection in Psalm 91, your prayers avail much for God answers your prayers!<br><br>

I received a testimony of God’s divine protection from Sally, who lives in South Africa. Be encouraged as you read how she prayed for protection knowing that she is righteous in Christ:<br><br>

I was driving a rented car when I heard a loud bang. Within moments, the car was on fire. I immediately switched off the engine to get out. But to my horror, I could not remove the seat belt or open the door! I was stuck.<br><br>

Finally, I managed to get the door opened. By then, the flames were threatening to come inside the car and I had to close the door again because I was trapped by the seat belt.<br><br>

I called out to Abba Father and just declared, “I am Your righteousness. You are the only One who can save me!” As those words were echoing in my ears and heart, I heard a click as the seat belt was released. I dashed out of the car.<br><br>

When the fire department arrived, they were able to stop the blaze. I praise the Lord for delivering me safely out of this dangerous situation! I realized that the devil has long been defeated and we don’t have to fear anything anymore.<br><br>

Praise the Lord for His deliverance and protection. I rejoice that we are shielded from danger because of the righteousness we have in Christ!

In famine He shall redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes. You shall laugh at destruction and famine.”</i><br>Job 5:19–22</font></strong><br><br>
            I believe the Lord gave me the following portion of Scripture, Job 5:19–22, to strengthen you. Let’s take a closer look at the first verse: “He shall deliver you in six troubles, yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.”<br><br>

Now, I have read this verse a number of times before, but the Lord quickened this Scripture in me, so let me share this fresh insight with you. I want to specially address those who have been greatly discouraged in the area of protection. Perhaps you have experienced a very difficult or even tragic event, or are going through a very challenging situation right now. Can I encourage you to build your faith upon His promises and not upon your experiences?<br><br>

The Word of God says that in this world, we will have trouble (John 16:33). The fact that God declares in His Word that He will deliver us from troubles tells us that we will experience troubles. But God wants us to know that the more we hear preaching on Psalm 91, the more we quote it and remind ourselves of the Lord’s protection daily, the more our faith in His protection will grow.<br><br>

Faith comes from “hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17). The more we hear, the more we believe! The more we claim and pray the prayer of protection, the more we will walk in its blessings.<br><br>

That is the intention of my teachings on Psalm 91—to saturate you with the hearing and hearing of the Lord’s protection promises for your life until your faith is robust and overflowing.<br><br>

My dear reader, deliverance from trouble is fantastic, but there is a promise that is even greater, and that is when you are at that place where “no evil shall touch you.” That’s my prayer for you and your loved ones.<br><br>

While we live in dangerous times, we have an almighty God who watches over us. May we all increase and have a progressive revelation of the Lord’s protection in these last days.<br><br>

While none of us, myself included, are there yet, we are on a journey of faith, of walking fully in the promises of God’s protection. Let’s give thanks to the Lord for His deliverance from all our troubles as we continue to believe we will come to the place where no evil will touch our loved ones and us!

         Her story is heartrending. In the Bible’s account, this woman in Luke 7 was described as “a sinner.” Many believe that she was a prostitute. When she came to Jesus, He did not chase her away, humiliate her, or condemn her for her sins. He knew how guilt had been eating her up on the inside and had compassion for her.<br><br>

As she neared Jesus, she began weeping. Then, she washed His feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, and anointed them with the precious ointment that would have cost her an entire year’s wages. Without hesitation, she lavished it on Jesus’ feet and worshiped Him.<br><br>

In response, Jesus said that those who know and believe how abundantly God truly loves and has forgiven them will end up loving God very much. Simply put, those who have been forgiven much, love much. Those who have been forgiven little, love little. That’s why the emphasis of the new covenant is not about your love for God; it is about God’s love for you.<br><br>

Do you see that your love for God in the new covenant is birthed out of a genuine and authentic relationship with Him? It is not a groveling display that is birthed out of the fear of punishment or religious obligation. Under grace, we are able to love God because He first loved us.<br><br>

That is why people under grace become the holiest people you will ever meet. Their holiness flows out of their love relationship with Jesus! They have experienced His unconditional love in an intimate and personal way that transforms them. They just want to live lives that glorify and honor the name of Jesus.<br><br>

Friend, we have all been forgiven much, but many don’t know and don’t believe this. Give up on trying to overcome your own failings, mistakes, addictions, and bondages, imagining that God requires this of you before you can come before Him.<br><br>

When you fail, come to Jesus with boldness and confidence as this woman did. Feel free to weep in His sweet presence and simply worship Him. Pour out everything that is on your heart to Him.<br><br>

Don’t worry, He will not heap more guilt and condemnation upon you. He will remind you of the cross and say, “Your sins are already forgiven. I have already paid the price for your sins at Calvary. Rest in My forgiveness and love for you.”

            When Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He wash away all your sins with His precious blood, but He also gave you His very own righteousness as a gift (2 Corinthians 5:21). Do you know that you can never lose this righteousness? Your righteousness is a gift from Jesus because it is entirely dependent on His perfect performance and His perfect obedience, not yours.<br><br>

So my friend, because you are forever righteous in Christ, God hears your prayers every time you pray. Apostle James tells us that the earnest prayer of a righteous man—that’s you—“produces wonderful results”. Not just plain results, but wonderful results!<br><br>

What provision do you need today, righteous one? Favor for an interview, wisdom to clear your debts, healing for your children? As a righteous man or woman of God, boldly ask Jesus for what you need in prayer!

          Today I’d like to share with you a powerful truth that will help you see how you can effectively drive fear out of your life and keep it out. It is a precious truth that will garrison your heart and mind from the enemy’s lies.<br><br>

Take time to worship the Lord, especially when it feels like overwhelming odds are against you. Do what King Jehoshaphat did when his enemies joined forces and amassed a formidable army to destroy Israel.<br><br>

In the natural, Jehoshaphat knew Israel had no chance of winning the battle. But he chose to do something you and I need to learn to do whenever we are besieged by our enemies. He cried out to the Lord, saying, “We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” (2 Chronicles 20:12). Jehoshaphat then placed not commandos but worshipers at the head of his army, and this is what they sang: “Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever” (2 Chronicles 20:21).

Instead of despairing because of their enemies, they chose to fix their eyes on the Lord, giving thanks to Him and singing of His love. This happened long before the cross of Jesus. How much more can you and I sing of His love, which never fails, which endures forever!<br><br>

And do you know what happened? The Lord defeated Israel’s enemies by turning them against each other, and Jehoshaphat’s troops did not even have to lift a finger to fight. Instead, when they came to the place that was supposed to be their battleground, their enemies were already dead, and all they ended up doing was collecting so much plunder that it took them three days to collect it all.<br><br>

In Jesus’ name, may this happen to you too. When you are overwhelmed by challenges, and you don’t know what to do or even how to feel, just cry out to the Lord and tell Him, “Lord, I don’t know what to do, but my eyes are on You.”<br><br>

That’s the most powerful posture you can take, with your eyes fixed not on your enemies but on your Savior. As you focus on His love that endures forever, the Lord Himself will fight your battle for you (2 Chronicles 20:15).<br><br>

May you be so conscious of His perfect love that every fear is driven from your life, and may you walk away so much stronger than before your enemies tried to come against you!

            Some people think that when they worship God, they are giving something to Him. On the contrary, I believe that as we worship and praise Him, He is giving to us, imparting His life, wisdom, and power into our lives, renewing our minds and physical bodies as well in His sweet presence.<br><br>

Worship is simply a response on our part to His love for us. We don’t have to, but when we experience His love and grace in our lives, we want to. It’s a response birthed out of a revelation in our hearts of just how great, how awesome, how majestic, and how altogether lovely our Lord and Savior truly is.<br><br>

As we worship Him and become utterly lost in His magnificent love for us, something happens to us. We are forever changed and transformed in His presence. All fears, worries, and anxieties depart when Jesus is exalted in our worship.<br><br>

We have seen this demonstrated through a worship collection, A Touch of His Presence (Volumes 1 and 2), that we compiled from spontaneous worship songs that flowed from my spirit during intimate times of worship when we simply occupied ourselves with the person of Jesus.<br><br>

I would sing out what God was putting in my heart, and He would manifest His loving presence. That’s when the gifts of the Spirit would operate and healings would break out among the people in the congregation.<br><br>

We received a letter from Emma in Germany who said, “Whenever the devil tries to attack me with symptoms of a disease, I would listen to these worship CDs and worship Jesus, my Lord, my Savior, and my Redeemer. I would also often partake of the Holy Communion while listening to the worship songs. After a few minutes, all the symptoms would disappear!” Another brother described how this worship music freed him from paralyzing, irrational fear and chronic sleep problems.<br><br>

I share these testimonies with you because I believe that some of you want to worship God, but you may not know where to begin when you are alone at home. If that sounds like you, then start by getting ahold of anointed Christian music that can fill your room with the presence of the Lord.<br><br>

Allow the music to simply wash over you like rivers of living waters. Let His presence flush out every fear and every anxiety. Let His love take away the cares that burden you. Let Jesus be magnified and glorified, and watch Him turn all things around for your good!

          I want to share with you this moving praise report from Melissa, a lady from Texas. I believe that you will be greatly blessed and inspired by the journey that she has taken to discover her true identity in Christ.<br><br>

From a young age, her mother told her she was a nobody like her father and would amount to nothing. She always felt worthless and even more so when she was molested as a child. Without having the love of her father, she desperately sought love in many relationships and partners, which led to a destructive lifestyle of sin, and feelings of deep unhappiness, confusion, and constant emptiness. Here’s what she said:<br><br>

I didn’t think of going to God and church because people I knew told me, “You’re going to go to hell because of your choices and how you’re living. God’s angry with you. He’s disgusted with you.” This was what I believed about God, and thought there was no way I could come to Him.<br><br>

Thankfully, I came across your television program when I was channel surfing. You were talking about the finished work of Jesus at the cross, and how much He loves me just as I am. I found that I couldn’t stop listening to the sermon. It was the start of my discovering how God gave His best—His Son, Jesus—for me, so that I could have a relationship with Him as my Daddy God and come into His presence without fear or shame.<br><br>

At the end of the sermon, you invited us to pray and ask God into our lives if we’d never done it before. I prayed that prayer, and as I was praying, I felt Jesus’ love just overwhelm me, and all the bitterness, confusion, unhappiness, and pain in my life just melted, as you like to say, “like butter.” The dull ache, the frustration, and the gnawing emptiness all just left, and for the first time, a joy I couldn’t explain came in.<br><br>

Since that time, so many amazing things and blessings have happened. Through experiencing Jesus’ love for me, I’ve been able to forgive my mother, and I’ve come to genuinely love her. I’ve also been able to forgive other family members who had told me I was worthless.<br><br>

Everything is so different now. I know that Jesus loves me and that He has great plans for me. I see His favor in my life. When I get a little frightened about things or situations in my life, I remember to cast all my cares to God. Even when I make a wrong turn, He always finds a way to bring me back. Whenever I’m in a negative situation, Jesus tells me the outcome is going to be good because He’s there and He’s working on it.<br><br>

I’ve learned to say, “I’m a new creation. I’m the righteousness of God in Christ. It’s not about what I’ve done but what Jesus has done.” Amazingly, the temptations that held me in the past have all lost their hold. It feels like I’d never lived a destructive lifestyle.<br><br>

Today, my life testifies that Daddy God loves and saves. More importantly, the change has been effortless—it’s all by the grace of Jesus. It’s had nothing to do with my willpower but the divine power of Christ at work in me. Thank you, Pastor Prince, for unveiling Jesus’ beauty and love for me. I feel so loved by Him and I’m so grateful for His finished work at the cross!<br><br>

My friend, the lies Melissa believed are the lies that the enemy wants you to believe. When you believe that you are truly a worthless nobody, you will start behaving as if you are a valueless and worthless nobody. That is the negative power of wrong believing.<br><br>

I have a word in season for you, and I want to challenge you to cultivate a robust revelation of your righteous identity in Christ by repeatedly confessing your righteousness in Christ.<br><br>

Throughout the day, whether you are driving to work, shopping for groceries, or preparing a meal for your family, just say quietly under your breath, “I am the righteousness of God in Christ. All the promises, blessings, and protection that belong to the righteous are mine” (Prov. 10:6). This is the key for you to experience lasting breakthroughs in your life!

            Let me now encourage you with a praise report on the power of praying and speaking Psalm 91 over our loved ones. This came from Brenda, who lives in Connecticut:<br><br>

<center><i>My twenty-four-year-old son, Lee, was crossing the street on a crosswalk in New York City when he was struck by a cab on the leg and thrown onto the hood of the car before landing on the street. Miraculously, he was totally fine after the accident! He did not have a single broken bone, bruise, or even a scratch.<br><br>
I recall that just a few days before the accident, we were having a wonderful time celebrating Thanksgiving. Suddenly, I saw in my mind an image of Lee on a slab and dead in a morgue. I immediately dismissed that image, proclaimed that my son would live and not die, and pleaded the blood of Jesus over him.<br><br>
I didn’t tell anyone what I’d seen, but just thanked God for His protection for my son and all my family members in Jesus’ name. The morning of Lee’s accident, I also felt led to pray God’s protection over my children from car accidents—not something that I usually do.<br><br>
Then, later that afternoon, I received a text from Lee telling me about the accident and that he was unharmed. After hearing my son was fine, I got on my knees and cried tears of joy, thanking my wonderful Father God! I am so thankful that the Holy Spirit warned me before the accident happened so I could pray for his protection.<br><br>
My son had just been awarded an awesome position in his company and we were all celebrating his wonderful new title and how God had opened up doors of favor for him. The accident happened just one day before he started his new job.<br><br>
At the time I learned about Lee’s accident, I was just listening to Joseph Prince’s message on Psalm 91. I used to pray it over my family all the time, but over the years, I had forgotten about this powerful psalm.<br><br>
    I am thankful to Joseph Prince for reminding me of the power of Psalm 91. When we pray the Word of God over our children or any situation, we release His angels to work on our behalf.</i></center>
Our God is such a good God, isn’t He? I trust that you are beginning to see how important it is to invest your time in getting His living and powerful Word into your heart, praying it over yourself and your loved ones, and speaking it out loud.

          The prophetic passage above speaks of our time. The interesting feature about the tabernacle of David in contrast to the tabernacle of Moses is that it had no veil separating man and God. David could go directly to worship the Lord before the ark of the covenant.<br><br>

When our Lord Jesus died on the cross and cried out, “It is finished!” (John 19:30), the Bible tells us that at that precise moment “the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51), opening the way into the Holy of Holies! Through Christ, there is no longer any separation between God and man. Whosoever believes in Jesus shall never perish. Hallelujah!<br>
                <img src="{% static 'images/jp15_01_24.png' %}" alt="JP" width="1200" height="1000"><br>
                <center>David’s tabernacle: David and<br>
the priests could praise God openly<br>
before the ark of the covenant.</center><br><br>
                Isn’t it wonderful to know that when you are in Christ, all your sins are forgiven, and that you can come boldly to His throne of grace to worship Him? God has raised up the tabernacle of David with a new generation of worshipers who are not afraid of God and not afraid to draw near and receive His promise of divine protection. None of us can ever do enough to merit God’s protection, but praise be to God, we are all qualified by the blood of Jesus Christ!<br><br>

On the night of the first Passover, when the children of Israel applied the blood of an innocent lamb on their doorposts, God said to them, “Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:13). Jesus became that innocent lamb that was sacrificed for us when He shed His blood and died on the cross.<br><br>

Today, as believers in Christ, His blood protects us. I’m believing with you that all evil, all destruction, and all danger shall pass over you and not come near you and your family. Let us come boldly to worship our Lord in the tabernacle of David where there is no veil. Come boldly under His wings and worship the Lord daily with the prayer of protection. His precious blood has been shed at the mercy seat for our total redemption, protection, and salvation.<br><br>

Psalm 91 was written for worship. Come boldly into our Lord’s presence daily and pray the prayer of protection. There is no veil, no failure, and no shame that separates you from God today because of our Lord’s finished work at Calvary. Come before your heavenly Father, worship Him, and receive His protection for you and your entire household!

            Our enemy the devil is well aware that the moment you learn to receive God’s grace, you will start to reign in life. So he has been working hard to prevent you from receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness.<br><br>

The devil has been using controversy as a device down through church history to prevent believers from having access to the most powerful truths of God. He has built fences of controversy around healing, prosperity, and grace (calling them heresies) to keep believers from reigning over sickness, poverty, and sin. You can always tell how powerful a truth is by the number of controversies the devil surrounds it with!<br><br>

Please pay close attention to what I am saying. Not all controversies are based on the truth of God’s Word. We have to test everything against what the Bible says.<br><br>

Nevertheless, controversy is a tool that the devil uses to prevent God’s people from accessing His truths. He is a crafty liar and deceitful thief, so we have to base what we believe on the Scriptures and test everything against it. If you want to know the truth about God’s grace, study His Word yourself and see what it has to say about grace!<br><br>

Pastor Prince, are you one of those “prosperity gospel” preachers?<br><br>

My friend, there is no such thing as a “prosperity gospel.” There is only one gospel in the Bible—the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

However, when you believe the gospel of Jesus, which is based entirely on His grace, it will result in health and abundance of provision. In fact, the gospel of Jesus Christ leads to blessings, success, healing, restoration, protection, financial breakthroughs, security, peace, wholeness, and much more!<br><br>

God blesses you not because you are good, but because He is good. It is based on His faithfulness and goodness toward you. It is not contingent on your performance, but on His undeserved favor.<br><br>

If it were contingent on how good you are, then it would no longer be grace but the law. It would be deserved favor. This is the difference between the old covenant of law and the new covenant of grace:<br><br>

Law is deserved favor—When you obey the commandments perfectly, you will be blessed.<br><br>

Grace is undeserved favor—Jesus obeyed God perfectly, and you will be blessed by believing in Him.<br><br>

My friend, which covenant are you under today? Law or grace? Deserved favor or undeserved favor? How do you see God—as your Judge or loving Father?<br><br>

If you think that being blessed by God today is dependent on your doing, your ability to keep the law, and your ability to make yourself righteous, I ask you to test your understanding of grace against the Scriptures.<br><br>

Read today’s Scripture again and open your heart to what it says about God and His grace toward you: God is your loving Father in heaven who loves you and has nothing but good gifts for you. He sent His Son to die for you so that you can enjoy every one of these good gifts. Today, receive His abundant grace!

          Several years ago, I had the privilege of counseling one of my wife’s close friends. Wendy’s friend was a young Christian who attended another church. Over dinner, she shared that one of her spiritual leaders had told her that the Christian life was difficult, and that she had to suffer for the Lord and pay her dues. She was told that she had to work hard, pray hard, and make sure that she read the Bible every day so that God would be pleased with her.<br><br>

Once she shared all that with us, I felt that it was my responsibility to tell her the good news. So I shared with her that we do not read the Bible because we want to qualify for God’s blessings. We read the Bible to find out about our blessings and inheritance in Christ.<br><br>

See the difference? I told her that if I stopped reading the Bible for a few days, I should not be feeling guilty; I should be feeling hungry.<br><br>

God is not pleased with us on the condition that we read the Bible, pray long prayers, and pay our dues. No, absolutely not! He is pleased with us because our trust is in Jesus, who qualified us.<br><br>

The Bible never said that it is our works that qualify us. Today’s scripture says, “giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.”<br><br>

It is the Father who has qualified us, and He qualified us by sending His Son to save us. He has qualified us to be partakers of His favor, healing, provision, love, joy, peace, and well-being. All these blessings are the inheritance of the saints, purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ. We partake of our inheritance by giving thanks to the Father for sending His Son.<br><br>

I shared with this lady that she can wake up every day and say, “Father, I thank You that You have qualified me to walk in victory, healing, and supply.” I told her that she should not be racking her brains wondering what she must do to qualify for God’s goodness. His goodness is already hers!<br><br>

There are too many teachings today telling believers what they must do to qualify for this and that. God’s way is for us to know that through Jesus, we are already qualified.<br><br>

At the end of the dinner, I said, “Test whatever I have shared with you about the goodness of God, His grace, and Jesus’ work at the cross against what you have been taught. Which produces peace in your heart? Joy and peace are the trademarks of the kingdom of God. God is not the author of confusion.”<br><br>

She reflected on what I had shared with her and said, “While I may not understand everything about Jesus because I am a baby Christian, I know that all you’ve shared has produced great peace and joy in my heart.”<br><br>

Let me ask you the same question today: what produces more peace and joy in your heart—to know that God will never punish and condemn you again for your sins because Jesus has already been punished and condemned for you, or to hear that God is sometimes pleased but sometimes angry with you depending on how you perform?<br><br>

Beloved, the answer is found in Jesus and His finished work. It is found in His grace, not in your own doing. By trying to qualify yourself today for God’s blessings with all your Bible reading, praying, and hard work, you are asking Him to assess and judge you according to your goodness and faithfulness.<br><br>

Is that what you really want? If not, then begin to put your trust in the finished work of Christ today and enjoy peace, joy, and every blessing that flows from His unconditional love for you!

            I’m sure you want the Lord to manifest Himself as the God of peace when you are fearful. So let’s go deeper into what the “God of peace” means.<br><br>

Don’t forget that Paul was Jewish, so when he said “the God of peace be with you,” he was saying “Jehovah Shalom be with you.” “Jehovah Shalom” is Hebrew for “the God of peace.” Now, the first appearance of the name Jehovah Shalom is in the Old Testament story of Gideon in Judges 6.<br><br>

As we read Gideon’s story, we discover that the Midianites terrorized Israel day and night, descending upon them like a swarm of marauding locusts and destroying their crops and pillaging their livestock. Fearful of their cruel enemies, the Israelites hid in dens and caves in the mountains.<br><br>

It is no wonder Gideon was petrified and hid himself at the bottom of an abandoned winepress to thresh the measly stalks of dry grain he had somehow managed to scavenge. He was bound by fear and overcome by all the news of terror that surrounded him.<br><br>

In the midst of Gideon’s fear, “the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, ‘The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor!’” (Judges 6:12).<br><br>

When you find the expression “the Angel of the Lord” in the Old Testament, it usually refers to our Lord Jesus in His preincarnate state. Jesus Himself appeared to Gideon when he was in the pit of fear and called him a mighty man of valor. Isn’t that amazing?<br><br>

Are there moments when you feel besieged by fear? When you hear reports of terror or exposure to some virus, do you feel fearful and anxious? Has fear driven you into hiding? The truth is, regardless of how you feel, when our Lord Jesus looks at you right now, He sees you as a mighty man or mighty woman of courage.<br><br>

Isn’t it amazing how our Lord looks at us? It’s not how we see ourselves that defines us; it is how our Lord Jesus sees us that defines us. That’s why we read His Word. We read it to discover what His Word says about us. My friend, no matter what state you are in right now and how messed up your life might be, the Lord Jesus sees the best in you.<br><br>

He sees your potential, your gifting, your call, and your destiny to do great things in this life! And as the ending of Gideon’s story shows, He will guide you and cause you to be a testimony of His protection as you trust in Him and see yourself and your situations through His eyes.

God instructed that the golden plate of the miter (headdress), which has the Hebrew words Kadosh Le Yahweh (“Holiness to the Lord”) engraved on it, should always be on the forehead of the high priest so that all Israel would be accepted before God (see the illustration).<br>
                <img src="{%  static 'images/jp17_01_24.png'%}" alt="JP" width="1200" height="1000"><br>
                <center>The high priest wears a gold plate<br>
bearing the words, “Holiness to the Lord”<br>
on his forehead.</center><br><br>
        What this means is that even when Israel failed in their thought life, they were still accepted by God because He judged the nation of Israel based on their high priest. If the high priest was accepted, the entire nation was accepted.<br><br>

Today we have a perfect High Priest in Christ. It’s not your thoughts that qualify you to be accepted by God. Under the new covenant of grace, God is no longer judging you based on your thoughts. God judges you based on His Son.<br><br>

If He is righteous, God sees you as righteous. If He is blessed, God sees you as blessed. If He is under God’s unclouded favor, God sees you as under His unclouded favor. If His thoughts are always perfect and filled with holiness unto God, God sees your thoughts as perfect in Christ!<br><br>

Today when the devil comes to torment your mind, point him to Jesus. Jesus’ thoughts are always holy. Remember how the golden plate is always around the forehead of your High Priest and His thoughts are always filled with holiness to God.<br><br>

Look at Exodus 28:38 again: “It shall always be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord.” Therefore, even when your thought life isn’t always perfect, know that Jesus’ thoughts are always perfect.<br><br>

And it’s because of His perfection that you are always accepted in Him before God. God will never reject you because your thoughts are imperfect. He is looking at Jesus, and as long as His thoughts are holy, you are accepted!

            Can I show you a beautiful picture of God’s love for you found in the story of Daniel? In Daniel’s case, the law of the land was violated and, in spite of his love for Daniel, the king had to carry out the law and punish Daniel. If he hadn’t, he would have been an unrighteous king.<br><br>

Now, imagine if someone came again a year later to accuse Daniel of this crime and asked for Daniel to be punished again, what would the king do? Would the king throw Daniel into the lions’ den again? No! Daniel had already been sentenced; he had already paid the price for his violation of the law.<br><br>

My dear friend, because our Lord Jesus has been punished on the cross in your place, the devil cannot come to the King and ask for you to be punished and thrown into the lions’ den. You see, your sins were forgiven not because the King simply decided to close an eye and let you off the hook. The King forgave your sins righteously after judging them in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>

He who was completely without sin took your place and bore the full weight of the punishment for your sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). ALL your sins have been legally and judicially judged at the cross. Because of His finished work, once you received the Lord Jesus into your heart, God’s justice and righteousness are on your side!<br><br>

Do you know how much God loves Jesus, His beloved Son and the apple of His eye? Then I pray that you will have a revelation of how much your Father in heaven loves YOU.<br><br>

To redeem you, God paid the price with the blood of His only Son. It must have been a most difficult decision for Him. None of us would ever fully comprehend what God experienced in sending His own beloved Son to the cross.<br><br>

We catch just a small glimpse of the torment that God suffered when we read about King Darius’s suffering. King Darius wanted to save Daniel, but he could not violate his own law.<br><br>

Similarly, God loves His Son, but He knew the only way to save us, who had violated the law, was to sacrifice His own Son, Jesus Christ. May this revelation of His amazing love and grace give you boldness to come freely to Him and find protection under His wings.

          Whatever you are facing in your life, you don’t have to run around trying to meet all your needs. You just need to seek Jesus Himself. When you have the person of Jesus, you have all the benefits that come with the person.<br><br>

Here is one particular aspect of the Lord that I want to draw your attention to.<br><br>

Throughout the Bible, we see pictures or personifications of God, such as Him being our fortress, our stronghold, and our tower. One of the most frequently used pictures is of God as our Shepherd. And many times we see the imagery of the shepherd and sheep used in the context of healing. For instance, read today’s scripture from Ezekiel.<br><br>

I love my wide-margin Bible because I can write my own notes and commentaries. Next to Isaiah 53:5–6 and 1 Peter 2:24–25, I wrote, “This imagery of Shepherd and flock promotes healing.” Let me show you something really powerful when you compare these two Scripture passages:<br><br>

But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.<br>

—Isaiah. 53:5–6<br><br>
Who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed. For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.<br>

—1 Peter 2:24–25<br><br>
During my time of study, I felt the Lord say to me, “The day My people really see Me as their Shepherd, and not just know it in their heads, but experience Me as their Shepherd, their days of sickness are over.”<br><br>

We were like sheep going astray, and that’s why we were sick. But we have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls. And because of that, we can have full assurance that by His stripes, we are healed.<br><br>

By the way, the word for returned in the original Greek text is in the passive voice. This means you are not the active agent here. It is the Holy Spirit who has brought you back and returned you. Do you remember the parable our Lord Jesus told about the shepherd who left the ninety-nine sheep to look for the one that was lost (Luke 15:1–7)?<br><br>

The Shepherd is the One who looks for the lost sheep, finds it, and lays it on His shoulder, rejoicing. Our part as sheep is to simply consent to be loved by Him, let Him carry us on His shoulders, and rest in His strength.

            My friend, do you believe today that God does not remember your sins? This is a truth that our finite human minds struggle to comprehend.<br><br>

How can an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God not remember our sins? An all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present God should rightly be able to remember every single detail of every sin that we have committed.<br><br>

But that’s not what the Word of God says. God declares, “For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more” (Hebrews 8:12). I believe many believers are fearful to come close to God today and receive what they need from Him because they don’t believe that God truly remembers their sins no more.<br><br>

My friend, simply believe God’s Word, that through the provision of Jesus’ sacrifice, God indeed remembers your sins no more! Start living without the cloud of guilt, shame, condemnation, and judgment over your head. Stand bold and righteous in Christ and expect to receive His best!

          It is the Father’s love for you that gives you the power to overcome every mistake, failure, and sin in your life. The Bible puts it this way: “Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace” (Romans 6:14). Isn’t that beautiful?<br><br>

Today you are living under the freedom of God’s amazing grace—His unmerited, undeserved, and unearned favor in your life. Grace gives you freedom. Freedom from lack, from fear, from addictions, from the torment of guilt, and from every curse and every sin! The more you experience the love and grace of your heavenly Father, the more you fall in love with Him and out of love with sin.<br><br>

Did you know that the enemy has no hold over people who know their Father loves them? If Adam and Eve had believed in God’s love for them, the devil would not have been successful in tempting them. Unfortunately, they chose to believe the lie that the serpent had planted by portraying God as stingy and selfish, as if He was withholding something good from them.<br><br>

That’s why I want you to be anchored in the Father’s love. You will be unshakable. You will have no desire to touch certain things, go to certain places, or be associated with certain people. You will keep away from negative influences because you trust your Father’s heart for you and believe that He only wants what’s best for you. You rest, knowing that He is watching out for you to protect you and insulate you from harm.<br><br>

I’ve seen that children who are secure in their father’s love are able to say no to all kinds of temptations. This is because that vacuum in their lives is already filled. They don’t have to do things to win the approval of their friends when they can find absolute security, identity, and approval in their parents’ love for them and, most of all, in their heavenly Father’s love for them.<br><br>

In the same way, when we trust in our Father’s love for us, we will have the power to say no to temptations. When you have an abiding revelation of just how valuable, precious, and righteous you are in Christ, it becomes increasingly easy to say no to sin.<br><br>

The more righteousness-conscious you are and the more conscious of how valuable and precious you are in Christ, the more you will know that your righteous identity in Christ and sin don’t go together—and the more you will experience the power to say no to temptation.

            The “secret place” speaks of a place in Christ, but it also speaks of intimacy. To be “under the shadow of the Almighty” is to be close to Him.<br><br>

There are times when I travel to Israel with my pastors and the sun is scorching hot. When we are outdoors, whether it is on the Mount of Beatitudes or in Capernaum, we always look forward to being under the shadow of a tree.<br><br>

The difference in temperature when we are under the protective shelter of a tree is like night and day. Out in the open, we wouldn’t last long under the scorching heat of the sun. But under the shadow of a tree, we can sit for hours, enjoying a time of refreshing as we discuss the Word of God.<br><br>

Beloved, being under the shadow of the Almighty speaks of closeness, intimacy, and protection. It speaks of a place of refreshing, coolness, and rest. When Psalm 91 talks about dwelling in the “secret place” of the Most High, that secret place is not a geographical location, but spiritual intimacy with our Lord Jesus.<br><br>

In the same way, the prayer of protection is not an incantation or some kind of magic chant that grants you protection. It is you valuing your position in Christ and your close relationship with Him, and being found in that secret place with Him.<br><br>

For more than a decade now, I have been teaching my church to declare Psalm 91 over themselves and their loved ones and to be conscious of the close relationship we as believers have with our Lord Jesus. Some years ago, I received a testimony of divine protection from a businessman who attended our church. He had been on a business trip and was staying at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia.<br><br>

While he was in the lobby of the hotel, a bomb was detonated right outside and it tore through the lobby. The blast was so powerful that he saw a body flying past him. After the dust had settled, he realized that although his shirt was splattered with blood, and debris was strewn all around him, he was completely unharmed. Amazingly, he had stepped behind a pillar at the very moment the bomb went off, and that pillar had shielded him from the direct impact of the explosion.<br><br>

Just think of what could have happened if this man had not reached the pillar at the precise second the bomb went off. All praise and glory to our Lord Jesus who watches over His own!

Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn’t even smell of smoke!</i><br>Daniel 3:26–27</font></strong><br><br>
          There is truly no other god who can rescue like our God. Whatever circumstances you might be thrown into, our Lord Jesus is the fourth man with you in the midst of the fire. Notice how He didn’t stand outside of the fire, but was in the fire together with the three friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, when they were thrown inside for defying King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.<br><br>

This brings a whole new meaning for us when we read the verse, “Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you” (Deuteronome 31:6).<br><br>

Our Lord doesn’t deliver you from afar; He is with you in the midst of your adversity. Call upon Him and He will answer you. When Jesus is with you, nothing can harm you!<br><br>

Don’t you just love how the Word of God describes the three friends when they came out of the furnace? They were in the fire, but it had absolutely no power over them. It did not even leave a trace of smoke on them! Now, that’s a beautiful picture of God’s divine protection!<br><br>

Beloved, as you call upon the Lord in your day of trouble, my prayer for you is that the trial you are going through will have no power over you; it will not even leave a smell on you. Instead, I declare in Jesus’ name that you will walk out of that challenge in your life and the only smell on you will be the fragrance of the Lord Jesus (2 Corinthians 2:14)!<br><br>

And as the people around you witness how the Lord delivers you, may they come to know His wonderful name and give Him praise. Instead of being negatively affected by whatever trial you might face, I pray that you will receive honor and promotion just like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Amen!

            As humans, not only do we have a propensity to zoom in on every little flaw in our physical and emotional makeup, but we also have a tendency to know, remember, and replay in our minds the sins, failings, and mistakes we have made. We condemn ourselves for even our smallest flaws instead of focusing on how God really sees us—perfect in Christ.<br><br>

This is why it takes faith to believe that God sees you righteous. It takes faith to believe that He does not see you in your sins, that He does not observe sin or iniquity in you. It takes faith to believe that He means what He says when He says, “For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more” (Hebrews 8:12). It takes faith to believe that God will not remember your failings and mistakes!<br><br>

But Pastor Prince, my sins are staring right at me. How can I have faith to believe that God doesn’t see them?<br><br>

My friend, the key to faith is found in looking to the source of faith—Jesus. As the Bible says, “fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith” (Hebrews 12:2). Your faith to believe is found in Jesus!<br><br>

The Amplified Bible puts it this way: “Looking away [from all that will distract] to Jesus, Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith [giving the first incentive for our belief] and is also its Finisher [bringing it to maturity and perfection].”<br><br>

In other words, turn your eyes away from your own flaws, imperfections, failings, and mistakes, and just fix your eyes on Jesus. The more you see Jesus and His finished work, the more faith arises in your heart to believe that all your sins are truly forgiven.<br><br>

You can start on a clean slate and have a brand-new beginning in Christ. The old is gone, and the new has come!

For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</i><br>Joshua 1:8</font></strong><br><br>
          Look at the instructions that God gave Joshua when he was appointed as Moses’ successor: “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”<br><br>

God told Joshua that to have good success, he had to meditate on the law day and night. Joshua lived under the old covenant, so how should we, who live under the new covenant, benefit from this scripture?<br><br>

We need to read this portion of Scripture in view of Jesus’ finished work. That is why it is essential for you to be firmly established on the rock-solid foundation of the new covenant of grace. Now that you know that we are no longer under the law, what is the new covenant way to be blessed and to experience good success?<br><br>

Joshua only had the law to meditate upon because the New Testament had not been written yet. For us, the secret to good success is found in meditating on God’s Word in the light of the new covenant of grace.<br><br>

Before we can go into what it means to meditate on God’s Word, what exactly does it mean to “meditate”?<br><br>

When the Bible talks about meditation, it’s not referring to a mental exercise. The Hebrew word for meditation in the Old Testament is the word hagah, which means to utter or mutter. So to hagah is to speak under your breath.<br><br>

Notice that the Lord told Joshua, “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth.” He did not say that it “shall not depart from your mind.” The key to meditating on God’s Word is not mental contemplation. It is in speaking God’s promises with your mouth!<br><br>

“Pastor Prince, does this mean that I should keep repeating God’s Word? For instance, should I keep saying ‘by His stripes I am healed’ when I need healing?”<br><br>

Meditating on God’s Word does not mean making vain repetitions of scriptures. It is much more and is something that first occurs deep in your heart. The psalmist David captured the essence of meditation most aptly when he said, “My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue” (Psalms 39:3).<br><br>

As you are meditating on God’s Word, ask the Holy Spirit to give you a fresh revelation of Jesus. Let that scripture burn with revelation in your heart. And as you speak out of that burning revelation, God anoints the words that you speak. When you declare, “By His stripes I am healed,” and that declaration is uttered with a sense of revelation and faith in Jesus, there will be power in your declaration!

            When the Scriptures are opened to you and things concerning Jesus are unveiled, your heart will be set aflame and burn within you as it did for the two disciples on the road to Emmaus.<br><br>

Don’t forget what Jesus did when He heard their wrong believing and conversation of defeat: “Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself” (Luke 24:27).<br><br>

In other words, beginning with the first five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, collectively known as the Torah), Jesus expounded all the things concerning Himself. Then He continued to reveal Himself in the books of the prophets, books such as Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.<br><br>

On the first day of His resurrection, Jesus set a precedent for us on how we ought to read and study the Bible today. He doesn’t want us to approach the Word to find out what we need to do and go away with a bunch of laws. Absolutely not!<br><br>

Jesus wants us to open the Scriptures to see HIM. See Him in everything from Genesis to Revelation. The more you see Him, the more you will be free from all forms of self-occupation and be transformed from glory to glory.<br><br>

I encourage you to open up the Bible and see Jesus in the types and shadows in the Old Testament. Every sacrifice, every feast, and even the tabernacle and priests point to Jesus.<br><br>

In the New Testament, see Jesus loving and forgiving those whom the world despised, such as the woman caught in adultery. See Him healing the blind, lame, and all who were oppressed with sicknesses and diseases. See Jesus multiplying provision for those who lacked.<br><br>

I promise you that your heart will burn, your body will be renewed, and your mind will be filled with His shalom-peace, joy, and soundness. I promise you that sin, addictions, bad habits, fear, guilt, anxiety, depression, and condemnation will drop off from your life when you are absorbed and occupied with the person of Jesus. They simply cannot coexist in your life when you are occupied with Christ and not yourself.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not condemned.”</i><br>John 3:17–18</font></strong><br><br>
          My friend, if you’ve been living in the abyss of fear for as long as you can remember, it is time for your liberty. You can begin on this journey of freedom today by believing that God’s heart is full of love, grace, and mercy toward you.<br><br>

Listen to your Father’s heartbeat in today’s scripture. Do you believe in Jesus? There is no condemnation for anyone who calls upon the name of Jesus! All who call on Him and believe in Him are not condemned but saved. That is the good news of the gospel.<br><br>

Unfortunately, many believers are still living under the heavy yoke of condemnation and fear because they hear the Mosaic covenant being proclaimed and put themselves under the Ten Commandments.<br><br>

Look at how the apostle Paul describes the Ten Commandments in 2 Corinthians 3:7–9: “But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious . . . how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.”<br><br>

Can you see the clear distinction that God makes in His Word? The Ten Commandments minister death and condemnation because no man was able to keep God’s perfect law.<br><br>

Failure to keep the law at any point brings you under its curse, condemns you, and hangs a death sentence over your head. See how in contrast, the covenant of grace “exceeds much more in glory” because it ministers the spirit of liberty and the gift of God’s righteousness.<br><br>

Now, please understand this: the Ten Commandments are glorious! The problem has never been the Ten Commandments or God’s perfect law. The problem has always been imperfect man’s ability to keep God’s perfect law. That is why our Lord Jesus came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it on our behalf (Matthew 5:17).<br><br>

And the law was perfectly fulfilled at the cross when He cried out, “Finished!” (John 19:30). He met the demands of the first covenant, which is the Mosaic covenant of the Ten Commandments, in order to put the second, which is the new covenant of God’s grace, into effect (Hebrews 10:9–10)!<br><br>

Beloved, we are in the age of God’s grace. That is why we preach the gospel of grace! My friend, the cross of Jesus has made all the difference! You no longer have to live in condemnation and fear under the old covenant of the law. You are now under the new covenant of grace, where you are fully forgiven, justified, and made righteous by Jesus’ blood to reign in life.<br><br>

When you realize you are justified by faith and not by your works in the new covenant of God’s grace, something liberating happens. You become free from the ministry of condemnation and the death it ministers—guilt, insecurity, dread, anxieties, and all sorts of debilitating fears.<br><br>

Condemnation robs you of peace in your heart and of joy in your relationship with your Father. It robs you of faith and confidence in His love and ability to save you.<br><br>

But when you know and believe you are not under the ministry of condemnation but the ministry of righteousness, you can come freely before your heavenly Father and cast every concern on your heart to Him. You will not be constantly fearful that your failures will cause Him to punish you or withhold His blessings and protection from you, because you know that Jesus bore the punishment meant for you upon Himself at the cross.<br><br>

My friend, perhaps you know what it’s like to battle fear every day. Perhaps you’ve been plagued by fears of being unable to cope with certain changes in your circumstances. Maybe fearful thoughts of losing your health, your job, your children, or your very life keep you awake at night. Perhaps you suffer from severe anxiety attacks and the very thought of going anywhere outside of your home fills you with suffocating fear.<br><br>

I want you to know that this is not the life God wants you to live. Through the sacrifice of His Son and the perfection of Christ’s finished work, He has made a way for you to live free from the captivity of fear.

</font></strong><br><br>
            One of the saddest things about a man who trusts in his strengths and self-efforts—“who . . . makes flesh his strength”—is that he cannot see good when it comes his way.<br><br>

As a pastor, I have seen, down through the years, people who don’t put their trust in the Lord when it comes to their marriages, finances, and other areas of weakness. They are determined to trust in their own efforts, and tend to be rather arrogant and frustrated with the people around them.<br><br>

Many a time, when you observe people like that, you realize that they cannot see the good things that are right under their noses. They don’t appreciate their spouses, neglect their children, and even when other blessings come their way, they miss them!<br><br>

Why is it that they can’t see good when it comes? It is because people who trust in their own efforts have no ability to see and receive blessings from the Lord. They only believe in the “good” that can come from their own efforts. That is why they are proud.<br><br>

You would probably notice that such people don’t say “thank you” very often to the people around them. They feel like they are entitled to and deserve whatever they receive. They are rarely grateful or appreciative, and that is why they take their spouses for granted instead of seeing them as a blessing from the Lord.<br><br>

In contrast, people who are living under grace and who trust in the Lord’s unmerited favor are constantly thankful, praising God, and giving thanks to Jesus. They are grateful and appreciative of the people around them.
<br><br>
When I was still a bachelor, I had an idea of the kind of wife I wanted and brought my request to the Lord. But you know what? He over-answered my prayer and gave me Wendy! I am truly grateful to the Lord for Wendy and I know that it is the unmerited favor of Jesus.<br><br>

When I look at my daughter Jessica, I know that I don’t deserve such a beautiful daughter, and yet the Lord gave this precious girl to me. You see, my friend, I did nothing to deserve it, but the Lord blessed me with an amazing family.<br><br>

When you live under grace, you can truly enjoy the blessings around you because you know that they are undeserved. Look at the family, friends, and other blessings that God has given you today. See how He has blessed you with them because He loves you. And when you see them as blessings, they will enrich your life (Provebs 10:22)!

          Most of us think that if we could just change our circumstances, we could have the lives we want. However, today’s scripture shows us that that is not what Jesus said. Do you see from His words that your life today is a reflection of what has been hidden and carried in your heart all this time?<br><br>

If you don’t want your life to remain the same, the solution is not in changing your circumstances. It is in changing your heart, changing what you believe.<br><br>

My friend, for every area of weakness, failure, or defeat that you may be experiencing right now, I assure you that there is some wrong believing in that area. Search the Scriptures for the truth. Your answer lies in right believing.<br><br>

Now, commit this to memory: right believing always leads to right living!<br><br>

Say it out loud for this is a powerful revelation you cannot afford to miss.<br><br>

Let me share with you a powerful testimony of a precious brother in my church who struggled with a smoking habit. He had been smoking for many years and went through at least one pack of cigarettes a day. Besides feeling lousy every time he smoked, he felt condemned and constantly heard the voice of the accuser bombarding him with accusations:<br><br>

How can you call yourself a Christian? Look at you—you are still a smoker! Give up, you hypocrite! You are not worthy to be a Christian.<br><br>

The more he heard the accusations, the more he smoked. Though he tried to muster all his willpower to overcome this destructive habit, he just could not do it. He knew that his body was a temple of God, and he sincerely wanted to glorify the Lord, but there was no power to do so.<br><br>

Then, he heard me preach on how the Holy Spirit is present in him to convict him of righteousness, and how the more he believed that he was righteous because of Jesus Christ, the more his behavior would line up with what he believed. So he began to confess this daily: “I am the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ,” even when he succumbed to the temptation and lit up. Every day, he would wake up, stare at himself in the mirror, and say, “I see a righteous man standing in front of me.”<br><br>

This brother really believed that he was righteous, not because of what he did, but because of what Jesus has done. And the more he believed that he was the righteousness of God in Christ, the more his nicotine addiction faded.<br><br>

He began to have a supernatural strength to cut down his daily tobacco intake within a short span of time. He began to replace the voice of the accuser that called him a hypocrite with the voice of the Holy Spirit that declared, “You are righteous in God’s eyes. God sees you as righteous as Jesus Christ today.”<br><br>

The voice of the Holy Spirit became louder and louder until he finally heard only His voice, and one day he woke up and realized that the desire for cigarettes was no longer there! Hallelujah!<br><br>

Can you see? Deliverance from destructive habits comes simply by believing the voice of the Holy Spirit and seeing yourself as the righteousness of God in Christ every day.<br><br>

Just being faithful in believing and confessing, “I am the righteousness of God in Christ,” will cause a power to be released in your life that overcomes the bondage to cigarettes, pornography, alcohol, drugs, or gambling. Today is the day that the Lord will set you free from every lie, guilt, and condemnation that the accuser has been bombarding you with.<br><br>

Please pray this prayer with me right now. My friend, let’s silence the voice of the accuser and allow Jesus to set you free to reign:<br><br>

Lord Jesus, I thank You for the cross. I thank You that when You died for me, Your blood cleansed me from all my unrighteousness and the sins of my entire life. You are my Lord and Savior. I give You all my addictions (and/or bondages) today. I am sick and tired of being defeated and condemned by the accuser. Today, I confess that because of Your blood, I am right now the righteousness of God. By the supernatural strength and power of the Holy Spirit who is present to convict me of my righteousness, I will be reminded every day that I am the righteousness of God through You. Amen!

            While it’s true that we live in dangerous times, I want you to know this: We have our Abba’s promise that we can live safe, secure, and protected no matter what turmoil may be around us. Our heavenly Father does not want His children partaking of the fear that has invaded the hearts of people of the world.<br><br>

In fact, He wants every trace of fear to be expelled from your heart, knowing that He has set you apart, and that He who watches over you never slumbers nor sleeps! When fear comes knocking, let God’s promises of protection fill your heart, mind, and mouth, and the God of peace, our Jehovah Shalom, will come into and move in your situation!<br><br>

Our Lord Jesus desires to have an intimate relationship with us and He loves it when we acknowledge our need for Him. He loves it when we allow Him to hide us under the shadow of His wings, close to His heart of love.<br><br>

The prayer of protection is not some magical chant or incantation that grants us protection. Our protection in the Lord is all about us being intimate with and close to Him.<br><br>

As you involve Him in your day-to-day life, you will see Him lead you by His wisdom and protect you from making unwise decisions. And I pray that you will see His protection manifested more and more as you grow in your revelation of how deeply loved you are by the Lord, who protects like no other.<br><br>

I am so grateful to the precious people who take the time to write to me to share the amazing stories of how the Lord has watched over them and their loved ones. My friend, God is no respecter of persons, and I believe that as you keep establishing your heart on the word of grace, as you keep hearing testimonies of His goodness, you will also experience miracles of deliverance, protection, and healing in your life. Whatever weapon the enemy may have fashioned against you, it will not prosper!<br><br>

Today, as you put your trust in the Lord, I pray that you will experience not just His divine protection in a greater measure, but every blessing that the Lord Jesus has purchased for you on the cross of Calvary. Beloved, as we garrison our hearts with the truths and promises of Psalm 91, I pray that we will truly live confidently and fearlessly in these dangerous times.

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”</i><br>Matthew 7:7–11</font></strong><br><br>
          There was a man in the Bible by the name of Jabez. His name was rather unfortunate. It means “sorrow” because his mother “bore him in pain” (1 Chrononicles 4:9).<br><br>

What a name to have! But Jabez cried out to God, “Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!” (1 Chronicles 4:10).<br><br>

Some preachers claim that believers should not pray “selfish” prayers for themselves to be blessed. Jabez’s prayer would probably fall under their definition of a “selfish prayer” as it was all about him asking God to bless him, enlarge his territory, be with him, and protect him.<br><br>

But God didn’t reprimand Jabez for asking Him for these blessings. Without any fanfare, the Bible in the very same verse simply records that “God granted him what he requested.”<br><br>

That was all. No drama, no long list of what Jabez had to do or not do. It’s really that simple. God heard his prayer and granted his request! No rebuke, no instructions, no “Jabez, if you want Me to bless you, you must first do this.”<br><br>

No, God honored the man’s faith and turned his sorrow into joy and his pain into blessings—all because he had an unshakable confidence in how good God is and asked big!<br><br>

My friend, have a good opinion of God. He is not out to get you. He loves you and desires to unleash His favor into every area of your life. He loves it when you call upon Him. And He promised that He would answer when you do. Just see Him declaring to you Jeremiah 33:3: “Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.”<br><br>

Could it be that we are not seeing many breakthroughs because we have made asking God for big things a taboo with our religious and legalistic rhetoric? Could it be that we are just not seeing many blessings because we have not been asking God and seeking Him with a confident expectation of good?<br><br>

My friend, it gives your heavenly Father great joy when you ask Him. It’s His good pleasure to bless you as well as your family (Luke 12:32). Stop being held back by erroneous beliefs about God, and start asking Him for whatever is on your heart today!

            Cold. Lonely. Frightening. Abysmal. In the valley of the shadow of death, we battle with hopelessness and the fear of being abandoned.<br><br>

But see how Jesus, our good shepherd, watches over and delivers us even though we walk—not by His leading—into the valley of the shadow of death. In that valley, He is still with us.<br><br>

He is not with us to say, “I told you so.” He is not standing there, with arms folded, to see how we will get out of the trouble we got ourselves into. No, He is with us to protect and deliver us with His rod and staff from the evil one.<br><br>

Beloved, Jesus is a shepherd whose tender heart toward you will never allow Him to forsake you when you need Him the most. See Him with you protecting you, delivering you from death, and bringing you safely through every season of darkness.

          Perhaps you are at a place where you feel like you can’t conjure up any more faith, let alone “not waver at the promise of God” like Abraham (Romans 4:20). Maybe you are thinking, I have tried and tried to believe for so long. I have no more faith to carry on.<br><br>

Let me show you what today’s verse says about Sarah. There was faith involved when Sarah conceived and bore a child. But if you think faith is awfully hard and that you simply have no faith, I pray this will encourage you.
<br><br>
How did Sarah receive her miracle after so long and when it seemed impossible in the natural? She “judged Him faithful who had promised.” It seems so simple, but therein lay her miracle.<br><br>

The faith walk isn’t hard. It is easy and effortless. When your faith runs out, judge God faithful. When you do not know how to have faith anymore, reckon on His faithfulness. Remember that He is faithful. Lean on His faithfulness.<br><br>

Don’t give up because you think you don’t have enough faith. Once God gives you a promise, it is not for you to conjure up faith. It is for you to rest in the One who promised, knowing that He is faithful.<br><br>

There is a beautiful verse I want you to emblazon across your spirit that will steady you in the fight of faith when it seems like your answers are not forthcoming: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself” (2 Timothy 2:13). Even when you are faithless, He remains faithful.<br><br>

At the cross, as Jesus carried all our sins, God the Father had to turn away from His Son, and Jesus cried out, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46). He paid the price for you and me to have God’s constant presence, and because of that, God will never leave you nor forsake you (Hebrews 13:5). He will never relax His hold on you.<br><br>

When you feel faithless, know that you don’t have to try to hold on to Him—He is the One holding on to you. The Bible says the Lord your God holds your right hand, saying to you, “Fear not, I will help you” (Isaiah 41:13).<br><br>

When you have no more strength to even have faith in your battle with your sickness, may I encourage you to do this? Take time to go into the Lord’s presence and tell Him:<br><br>

Lord Jesus, thank You for Your faithfulness to me. You are faithful in Your goodness to carry out Your promises in my life. You are faithful to heal me and to restore to me every bit of health and well-being I have lost through this sickness. Right now, because You are faithfully upholding me, I can let go and rest in You. It is Your faithfulness that will cause my healing to manifest. Amen.

            Fear is a destructive bondage. Fear paralyzes you and prevents you from fulfilling the amazing destiny that God has for you. Fear makes you feel inadequate and insecure, and comes with unhealthy side effects ranging from panic attacks to sleep disorders.<br><br>

Fear is irrational. Fear is a spiritual condition, which is why you can’t reason fear away. You can’t simply tell someone who is struggling with fear and gripped by panic attacks to just stop being fearful. A spiritual condition cannot be remedied naturally. Fear can be eradicated only by a personal encounter with the person of Jesus.<br><br>

Beloved, if what I just described about fear is all too familiar to you, I want you to know that it is not your heavenly Father’s heart for you to live tormented by fear. There is no fear in God’s love. His perfect love drives out all fears.<br><br>

I don’t know if you have ever experienced God’s love, but my desire is that TODAY you will catch a revelation of His love for you in a deep and personal way. And as His love floods your heart, I pray that every fear that has you bound will forever be cast out of your life.<br><br>

John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”<br><br>

Oh, how clearly this verse proclaims that God SO loves you. And if you only knew how much He esteems and treasures His beloved Son, you would catch a glimpse of how much He loves you, because He gave up His Son for you.<br><br>

That is why I preach and write about the gospel of grace. The gospel of grace is all about unveiling God’s perfect love—a love whose length and depth and height were demonstrated at the cross.<br><br>

A love that gave up the Son of God as a sacrifice. A love that bore your sins and mine, so that we can receive His everlasting life and live free of any bondage.<br><br>

My friend, the more you immerse and anchor your heart on God’s perfect and unconditional love for you, the more fear will lose its hold on your life!

          Today, let’s look at the Greek word for repentance—metanoia. Meta means “change,” while noia is from the word nous, which means “mind.” So metanoia or repentance means “a change of mind.”<br><br>

Why is changing your mind important? Simply because right believing always leads to right living.<br><br>

When you believe right about God’s grace, about your righteousness in Christ, and how you are called to be set apart for holiness, everything changes! His love touches you in the deepest recesses of your heart and you begin to experience transformation from the inside out.<br><br>

That’s the grace revolution in action. You begin to live above defeat and experience lasting breakthroughs because the power to fight off any temptation is not from without, but from within. It is not contingent upon your willpower; it is contingent upon the power of the Holy Spirit living mightily and actively in you, bearing witness to the gospel truths you believe.<br><br>

This precious testimony I received from Robert bears out this point poignantly:<br><br>

I am a pastor in North Carolina who was preaching right living and trying to live right and do increasingly more to serve Jesus. But I also had a fifteen-year struggle with addiction to spit tobacco. I even stood on the pulpit one Sunday and confessed my addiction. I held up a can of tobacco and said that I, as David did to Goliath, would cut off its head and feed its carcass to the birds.<br><br>

Full of remorse, I told the people I had resolved to put the addiction away, and many came to the altar that day to cast off their addictions too. However, I was back at mine within a week and feeling great condemnation. I fought and fought, quit and quit, over and over again.<br><br>

Eventually a friend gave me some of Pastor Prince’s teaching materials. I was amazed at what I was hearing and reading, because I had never heard the gospel preached in this manner. I knew it was truth and it began to set me free. I heard Pastor Prince preach a sermon where he said that the solution was to quit trying to win on my own and to confess to the Lord, “Lord, I cannot, but You can.”<br><br>

This became my motto and I quit trying to quit using tobacco. I no longer stayed buried under guilt and condemnation. I believed and confessed that even though I was struggling with this tobacco habit, God still loves me no less and that Jesus’ finished work still avails for me.<br><br>

I can now testify that I have been tobacco-free for more than a year. Every time an urge pops up, I say to the Lord that I know His grace and what He has for me are much better than tobacco, and the urge leaves.<br><br>

Praise God! This message of unmerited favor has changed my life and ministry. I am now preaching and teaching grace every time I step onto the pulpit! Thanks be to God and thank you, Pastor Prince.<br><br>

My dear reader, no matter how long you may have struggled with a bad habit, I want you to know it is never too late to invite our Lord Jesus and His grace into your situation. It is never too late to return to His grace, the only power that can give you permanent inside-out transformation.

            I encourage you to start every new day with this thought: “God loves me and gave His only Son for me. Jesus is all for me today. I am saved, healed, favored, righteous, and accepted in Christ the Beloved.”<br><br>

Start your day by occupying your mind with Jesus. For a season in my life, before I even got out of bed, I would repeat to myself over and over again, “I am the righteousness of God in Christ.”<br><br>

Some mornings I would say it more than fifty times. I wanted it to be a revelation pulsating in my heart, an unshakable belief that God is for me and with me. When you occupy your mind with Jesus, every struggle, fear, and bondage that you are entangled with will lose its evil grasp on you!<br><br>

There is a beautiful picture of Jesus hidden in the Old Testament. Under the old covenant of the law, those who sinned were told to bring a sheep that was without blemish, wrinkle, or spot to the priest. The priest does not examine the person to see if he is perfect (without sin), because he has sinned. So the priest examines the sheep.<br><br>

If the sheep is indeed perfect, the person who has sinned lays his hands on the sheep in an act of transferring his sins to the innocent sheep. At the same time, the innocence and perfection of the sheep are transferred to the person.<br><br>

The sheep is then killed, and the person leaves with his conscience cleared and his sin debt forgiven. He walks away under an open heaven of God’s favor and blessing.<br><br>

Can you see Jesus in this Old Testament practice? The sheep without blemish, spot, or wrinkle is a picture of the perfect Lamb of God, Jesus Christ Himself, who takes away the sins of the world.<br><br>

The priest is a picture of God. He doesn’t examine you for your sins. Instead, He examines Jesus, and because Jesus is gloriously perfect, you can live today with your conscience cleared and your sin debt forgiven.<br><br>

You can walk under an open heaven and expect God’s favor and blessings in your life. What a beautiful picture of God’s abundant and lavish grace.<br><br>

Today, turn your eyes away from yourself and stop the self-introspection! Look to Jesus, the Lamb of God, and see His perfection as your perfection. See His innocence as your innocence, His righteousness as your righteousness. Be occupied with Him, and be transformed from the inside out.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most High. And he blessed him and said: “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”</i><br>Genesis 14:18–20</font></strong><br><br>
          I don’t know what valley you are in right now, but I want to share a powerful picture in the Bible that I pray will encourage you.<br><br>

Every time something is mentioned in the Bible for the first time, it is always significant. Do you know where you find the bread and the wine of the Communion mentioned together for the first time? It’s there in today’s scriptures.<br><br>

Who is Melchizedek? The Bible tells us that our Lord Jesus is “a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek” (Hebrews 7:17). Many scholars believe he is a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. But it is clear that Melchizedek is a type of Christ.<br><br>

Melchizedek was the king of Salem, which means “peace.” But Salem means much more than peace. It also means “complete, safe, perfect, whole, and full.”<br><br>

Melchizedek met Abram in the Valley of Shaveh, or the King’s Valley (Genesis 14:17). The King’s Valley is actually in the Kidron Valley. Kidron in Hebrew is from the word qadar, which means “darkness.”<br><br>

Melchizedek wasn’t the only person present with Abram. Bera, the king of Sodom, went out to meet Abram before Melchizedek arrived (Genesis 14:2, 17). Bera’s name in Hebrew means “son of evil.”<br><br>

I gave you all that background because I want you to see this: when you are in a place of darkness, your Lord Jesus comes to you, bearing bread and wine.<br><br>

You might be asking, “Won’t the Communion become something legalistic that I have to do?” Not if you see yourself receiving the bread and the wine from the Lord Jesus Himself. The Communion is not something that you do; you receive the Communion just as Abram did.<br><br>

In your time of darkness, don’t forget that the Lord has given you the Communion as a tangible, practical way of remembering all He has done for you and encountering His love. You don’t have to handle the situation all by yourself. The Lord is with you, and He wants you to bring Him every fear and every worry. Talk to Him.<br><br>

Whenever I am afraid I like to sing the words from the psalms of David to strengthen myself in the Lord. May you be filled with His strength as you meditate on and worship Him with these words from the psalmist:<br><br>

You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance . . . Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.

            The Bible promises something when you have wisdom: “Happy is the man who finds wisdom . . . Length of days is in her right hand, in her left hand riches and honor” (Proverbs 3:13, 16). Unfortunately, for King Solomon, he only had the left hand of wisdom, which holds riches and honor. The Lord had said to him, “If you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments . . . then I will lengthen your days” (1 Kings 3:14).<br><br>

For Solomon, who was under the old covenant of law, the blessing of length of days was a conditional one, which he could receive only if he was able to keep the law perfectly. However, Solomon failed to do so and he did not enjoy length of days, which is in wisdom’s right hand.<br><br>

Today, because we are under the new covenant of grace, Jesus is at the Father’s right hand and He is our wisdom. And when we have Jesus, we can be blessed with the two hands of wisdom because of His finished work on the cross. This means that riches and honor, as well as length of days, belong to us! What an awesome God we serve!<br><br>

Beloved, pursue Jesus and you will experience wisdom in every area of your life. You cannot try to earn, deserve, or study to acquire God’s wisdom. It comes by His unmerited favor.<br><br>

His wisdom will give you good success in your career. It will cause you to succeed as a student, parent, or spouse.<br><br>

For instance, if you are facing some problems in your marriage, God will not just “zap” your spouse and make him or her do a moonwalk and come back to you! The same thing that drove your spouse away from you in the first place will just drive him or her away again. What you need is wisdom for your marital situation!<br><br>

If you are faced with a crisis in your business, depend on the Lord for His wisdom. There are no “money problems,” only “idea problems.” Trust that the Lord will bless you with the wisdom from heaven to cause everything that you touch at your workplace to prosper. God’s wisdom always leads to promotion and good success.

          I am sure that you have heard a lot of teaching on fearing the Lord. I do believe in a reverential honor of the Lord. But I am not for any kind of teaching that promotes this idea that God wants you to be afraid of Him.<br><br>

Instead, God delights in having us close to Him. He welcomes us to dwell in His secret place, to be so close to Him that we come under His shadow.<br><br>

These are all pictures of intimacy. In any relationship, fear and intimacy cannot coexist. If you fear God today, you won’t be able to believe Him for His protection. That is why it is so important for you to be strong and established in His grace.<br><br>

The author of the book of Hebrews says, “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16). This is a picture of the ark of the covenant, God’s throne of grace.<br><br>

Because our Lord’s blood has been shed on the mercy seat, today, we can come boldly into His presence without any sense of inferiority or shame, and receive His favor, His supply, His protection, and His help in our time of need.<br><br>

Jesus defined the fear of the Lord as the worship of the Lord. In the wilderness temptation, Jesus responded to the devil by saying, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve” (Matthew 4:8–10). Our Lord was quoting from Deuteronomy 6:13, which says, “You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him.” Our Lord substituted the word “fear” with the word “worship.”<br><br>

Jesus was showing us how to accurately understand the fear of the Lord. In the new covenant, it has nothing to do with being afraid of the Lord; it has everything to do with coming into His presence with boldness and worshiping Him.<br><br>

Stop living in fear, my friend. Instead, follow our Lord wholly like Caleb did and worship His wonderful name. The prayer of protection is a psalm of worship.<br><br>

When you worship Jesus, all your fears will fade away. When you worship Him, the angel of the Lord encamps around you like a shield of protection. When you worship your Savior, His Spirit of wisdom and counsel will lead and guide you with rivers of peace!

            Listen to the words that God pronounced over Abraham: “I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2).<br><br>

My friend, as you trust God to walk more and more in the fullness of Abraham’s blessing, have a revelation that He blesses you because He loves you, and gives to you the privilege of being a practical extension of His love to your community, your country, and beyond.<br><br>

God’s financial provision is for a divine purpose. Don’t use people and love money. Instead, use money to love people!<br><br>

When it comes to our relationship with people, it is always more blessed to give than to receive. Have an abundant eye and heart, look around for people in need and bless them. Let your light so shine before all men for the glory of the name of Jesus Christ!<br><br>

Today, see His abundant grace abounding toward you and your family so that you will have an abundance for every good work!

          No matter where you are, the Lord is with you. Even in the midst of your fears, while you are alone in your room, He is there with you.<br><br>

The moment you begin to be aware of His presence and cultivate His presence, all your fears, anxieties, and worries will melt like butter on a hot day, or as the psalmist David puts it, “The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD.”<br><br>

You cannot psych yourself out of fear nor can you psych yourself out of worry. You can’t just tell yourself, “Come on, stop worrying. There is nothing to worry about.”<br><br>

It just doesn’t work. The debt will still be staring you in your face and your problems will still be as insurmountable as ever no matter how hard you try to psych yourself up. That is what the world is trying to do, but it does not work. It takes the presence of the Lord to keep you free from worry.<br><br>

Jesus is not asking you to psych yourself up and live in a state of denial. No way! He is saying to you, “In the midst of your affliction, I am your shield. I am your defender. I am your fortress. I am your refuge. I am your supply. I am your healing. I am your provider. I am your peace. I am your joy. I am your wisdom. I am your strength. I am the glory and the lifter of your head!” (Psalm 3:3). Amen!<br><br>

He is not asking you to pretend that the facts are not there. He wants you to realize that HE IS THERE WITH YOU!<br><br>

When you know that He is with you and for you, and you put your problems in His mighty hands, you will begin to get a more accurate evaluation of just how “big” your problems are. When they were in your hands, the weight and burden of your problems may have crushed you. But when you involve Jesus, the once-monumental problems become microscopic against the largeness of His love and goodness toward you!<br><br>

Today, as you consider all that you need to do and the expectations placed on you, see Jesus there with you. He is your supply, wisdom, peace, and strength.

            You may have read of how Joseph in the book of Genesis wanted his family to dwell in Goshen, which means “drawing near.” He wanted them in a place of nearness to him and he told them, “There I will provide for you” (Genesis 45:11).<br><br>

Beloved, even in the midst of famine, Jesus, our heavenly Joseph, wants us close to Him so He can provide for us. In the book of Exodus, God declared, “I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there” (Exodus 8:22).<br><br>

In the land of Goshen, God’s people were protected from all of the ten plagues that besieged the land of Egypt during the time of Moses. In the second last of the ten plagues, a thick, paralyzing darkness covered the land of Egypt for three whole days. Yet, during that time, “all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings” (Exodus 10:23).<br><br>

I believe it was a supernatural darkness that covered Egypt, because the Egyptians must have turned to natural resources of light to dispel the darkness—only to find they couldn’t. By the same token, it was a supernatural light that the Israelites enjoyed in Goshen, a light the darkness tried to smother but couldn’t.<br><br>

Now, I believe this is prophetic of our times. The Bible is relevant for today. We are living in days where we see darkness—a supernatural darkness—cover the earth.<br><br>

Yet, the Scriptures tell us that even when there’s thick and deep darkness all around, the church—you and I, together with our families—can experience and enjoy God’s supernatural light in our dwellings. We, who have been drawn near to Him through the work of His Son, can have intimacy with God and enjoy His protective covering to live fear-free and victoriously in these dark times.<br><br>

Beloved, in the place of nearness, God makes a difference between His people and the people of the world. We are in this world, but we are not of this world (John 17:14).<br><br>

We are His. He desires for us to be close to Him so that He can hide us under the shadow of His wings. He paid the price so that we can be called His children. Oh, what manner of love the Father has given unto us, that we should be called the sons and daughters of the Most High (1 John 3:1)!<br><br>

Beloved, whatever may be happening in the world today, you can be bold and fearless because nothing can ever separate you from the love of God, your heavenly Father!

          Our Lord Jesus went into a synagogue on the Sabbath, and a man was there with a withered hand. The Pharisees were looking for opportunities to accuse Jesus of wrongdoing, so they challenged Him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”<br><br>

Our Lord answered, “What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand,” and restored it as whole as the other (Matthew 12:9–13).<br><br>

This is what I want you to know: when someone is sick, the Lord never faults and condemns the person. He sees the person as a sheep that has fallen into a pit and needs rescuing.<br><br>

If you are dealing with a medical condition, don’t allow the accuser to disqualify you from receiving your healing by telling you things like, “You should have watched your diet” or “You should have exercised more.” Even if you were at fault, the Lord Jesus can heal you, and He is most willing to.<br><br>

That doesn’t mean you neglect wisdom in taking care of your health. If you allow Him to, the Lord can lead you even in practical matters like what to eat and how to exercise. The key here is not to pay attention to the voice of shame, condemnation, and accusation. Listen instead to the voice of your Shepherd coming to rescue you!<br><br>

Our Good Shepherd says He gives His life for the sheep (John 10:11). But do you know the context of this verse? Let me show you:<br><br>

“The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.”<br>

John 10:10–11<br><br>
Even though He is our Shepherd, He laid down His life as the Lamb of God. Revelation 5:12 declares, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.”<br><br>

Why does God use the picture of the Lamb and not the Shepherd in the sacrifice? Because God wants you to see that Jesus died in your place. He, the Good Shepherd, became the Lamb of God for you.<br><br>

You can have life more abundantly not because you deserve it but because He gave His life for yours. He took your sicknesses and your pains and gave you His wholeness and His health.<br><br>

Today hear your Lord Jesus saying to you, “Do not fear, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Whatever condition you might be faced with, you can believe you will see the full manifestation of your healing. Keep partaking of the Tree of Life through the holy Communion and allow His abundant life to flood your body each time you partake.

            Psalm 91:4 starts with “He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge” and ends with this proclamation: “His truth shall be your shield and buckler.”<br><br>

What is the shield and buckler? A buckler refers to a small round shield used for close-contact fighting. A shield is much larger, one you can dig into the ground and hide behind when spears, arrows, or rocks are being launched at you in a bigger attack. So whether it is a small or big attack, His truth—your shield and buckler—covers you completely!<br><br>

In Ephesians 6:16, it tells us to, above all, take the shield of faith to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. Why? Because the shield of faith will cover you all around. Amen!<br><br>

That is why the devil is after your shield of faith—he wants to make you doubt God’s Word, which is His truth. Once you take up the shield of faith, his attacks against you cannot prosper. So lift up your shield!<br><br>

My dear reader, as you listen to messages about Jesus’ finished work and your faith is being built, your shield is also being built. Even if you are found in the wrong place at the wrong time, the Lord can protect you when His shield of faith surrounds you and you are placed under the shadow of His wings.<br><br>

One of our church members was driving on the freeway with his family and came behind a van that had a queen-size mattress tied to its roof. Suddenly, the ropes that secured the mattress to the van snapped and the mattress came hurtling toward his vehicle. He and his wife braced themselves for impact, expecting the large mattress to crash into their windscreen, since there was no way they could avoid it in time.<br><br>

Miraculously, the mattress somehow hit the road just in front of their car, bounced to the side, and hit another car instead. Thankfully, the driver of that car was able to brake in time and did not cause an accident.<br><br>

For our church member, it was as if a force field—or an invisible shield—had protected his whole family! Can you imagine what could have happened if that large mattress had crashed into the windscreen of his car, which was ferrying his wife as well as their young children in the backseat?<br><br>

Let’s give thanks to the Lord, for He is so good and His tender mercies endure forever! Truly, He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge.

            <td class="aceem"><strong><font color= "green"><i>Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you.”</i><br>1 Samuel 17:45–46</font></strong><br><br>
          Beloved, start practicing God’s love for you and it will translate into victories in your daily life. I am sure you are familiar with the story of how a young shepherd boy named David came against an ugly bully of a giant named Goliath and defeated him. I want you to know that this can be your story and testimony too.<br><br>

There are no insignificant details in the Bible. Even the names in the Bible carry secrets for our benefit. The name “Goliath” comes from the Hebrew root word, galah, which means “to exile.”<br><br>

To be exiled is to be stripped of everything you are and everything you own. So Goliath’s name essentially means that he had been stripped of everything—an exile. What a name! Goliath is a picture of the devil as he really is—stripped of all his weapons against us because of the cross (Colossians 2:15).<br><br>

The name “David” on the other hand means “beloved.” The battle in the valley of Elah was thus a battle between a beloved of God and a stripped exile.<br><br>

Now, catch this revelation: it takes someone who knows that he is the beloved of God to bring down a giant! This is the secret of becoming a giant slayer!<br><br>

It doesn’t matter what your giant is today. It could be a marital problem or financial situation. Begin to see that you are God’s beloved and your giants will come tumbling down.<br><br>

My friend, God loves you. You are His beloved child regardless of what you have or have not done. He loves you as you are because the truth is that you have been washed whiter than snow with the blood of Jesus.<br><br>

Live every day by these words from your loving Father in heaven: “You are My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.” His favor is all over you, whether you are with your family, or in your workplace, and in everything that you do. You are a blessing everywhere you go.<br><br>

If God did not withhold His Son from you, why would He withhold healing, financial provision, protection, peace of mind, and all the other blessings from you? When the Almighty God is your loving Father and you are His beloved child, what fears can you have?<br><br>

Fear of the past, the present, and the future? Fear of not having enough? Fear of sickness? Fear of death? Fear of punishment?<br><br>

Beloved, when you have a revelation of how much God loves you and that He sees you completely righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ, all your fears will dissipate, for if God is for you, who can be against you (Romans 8:31)?<br><br>

Are there giants in your life that need to be slain? Look away from your circumstances and call out without fear to your Father. He loves you and will never judge or condemn you! He loves you with an everlasting love.<br><br>

It is not enough to know that God loves everyone. You need to know and believe that He loves you, and let that revelation warm and anchor your heart in His grace, especially when you fail.<br><br>

And as you keep on feeding on His love for you, His love will start overflowing in you, and you will receive from Him exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think! With God on your side, nothing is impossible!
